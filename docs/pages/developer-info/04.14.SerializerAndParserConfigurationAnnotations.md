Added in 8.0.1 is a simplified approach for customizing serializers and parsers in REST interfaces using annotations.

The following example shows the old approach of using a generic **`@RestResource(properties)`** annotations, and the new approach of using specialized annotations:

Annotations are provided for all serializers and parsers:

Features:

* Annotations can be applied to classes and methods.
* Annotations can also be applied to parent classes and methods and are combinable and overridable, applied in parent-to-child order.
* All annotations support SVL variables (e.g. "`$C{myConfigVar}`").
* Default values for all annotations can be set as system properties.
* Default values for all annotations can also be set in the main configuration file or application.properties file.
* Annotations can be applied to serializers and parsers directly using new **`applyAnnotations(Class)`** and **`applyAnnotations(Method)`** defined on the serializer and parser builder and group builder classes.
