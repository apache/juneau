title: Becoming a contributor
---

We are actively looking for contributors to join and take an active role in the project!

To become a contributor, we recommend joining and contributing code changes through the mailing list. Once you're contributing and your work is good, one of our team may invite you to be a committer. After that, the team will call for a vote. When that happens, if you accept, the following process kicks into place:

* Download and print the Apache Contributor License Agreement from the [New committers guide](https://www.apache.org/dev/new-committers-guide.html).
* Sign and fax (or email) the CLA to Apache.
* Wait for your name to appear on the [list of received CLAs](https://whimsy.apache.org/officers/cla). Once that's done, let us know and we can apply to Apache Infrastructure to have your account created. We'll need the following information: Full name, preferred email address, preferred unix account name.
* Read the [New committers guide](https://www.apache.org/dev/new-committers-guide.html).
* More information for new committers can be found in the [Committers information doc](https://www.apache.org/dev/committers.html).

The Juneau project does not currently have distinct roles for Committers and PMC (Project Management Committee). All Committers are also voting members.
