Hi all,

I've made some modifications to the work that Marcelo contributed for the Spring Boot integration. I still consider this in flux though and suggestions are welcome.

Here's the updated project layout:

Here's what it looks like to start up a Spring app with Juneau Examples REST resources:

Another option is to add the @JuneauRest annotation on your configuration bean method:

The root resource will be initialized with the **SpringRestResourceResolver** which allows for child resources to be defined as injectable Spring beans.

The app can be launched from Eclipse using the **juneau-examples-rest-springboot.launch** file. It will bring up the REST examples on port 5000.
