This document provides information on adding new Committers/PMC members to Apache Juneau.

The Apache Juneau team does not differentiate between Committers and PMC members. Any member of the PMC can propose a new member of the PMC.

## Summary

The general process is as follows:

1. Discussion
2. Call a vote
3. Close the vote
4. Invite the new committer

If they accept, then do:

1. If committer is also to be a PMC member, nominator sends email to board@ asking for acknowledgement of new PMC member
2. Wait 72 hours for lazy acceptance by the board
3. If the candidate is already a committer on another project, accept the committer and skip to step 8
4. Accept the committer and request they file an ICLA, notifying the PMC and choosing an available Apache id
5. Wait until we see that receipt of iCLA (Individual Contributor License Agreement) is recorded
6. Request creation of the committer account if not already done by Secretary
7. Now wait until root says it is done
8. PMC Chair to enable svn and other access
9. Add committer to the appropriate groups in JIRA and CWiki
10. Notify the committer of completion
11. Announce the new committer

## Discussion

Before approving membership, it's assumed that the person has actively contributed through this process:  
[Contributing for Non-committers](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/JUNEAU/Contributing+for+Non-committers)

Once it's been shown that the member submits good work, the team can invite them to be a full member.

```text
To: private@juneau.apache.org
[DISCUSS] Jane Doe PMC membership

I'd like to discuss adding Jane Doe as a PMC member.

State reason why.
```

## Call for vote

If there is consensus that the proposed member is suitable, then there should be a formal vote in the PMC private alias:

```text
To: private@juneau.apache.org
[VOTE] Jane Doe PMC membership

I'm pleased to be calling this vote for inviting [Jane Doe] to be a member of the Juneau PMC.

This vote will be open at least until 04-May-2016 1:30pm and passes if a majority of at least three +1 Apache Juneau PMC votes are cast.
(needs to be at least 72 weekday hours)

[ ] +1 Approve invitation
[ ] 0 I don't feel strongly about it, but don't object
[ ] -1 Do not approve invitation because...

State reason why.
```

## Close the vote

If the vote is successful, the proposer should send a message to the PMC private alias.

```text
To: private@juneau.apache.org
[VOTE][RESULT] Jane Doe PMC membership

Voting for PMC membership for [Jane Doe] is now closed. The vote has passed with the following tally:

John Smith, PMC, +1
...
``` 

## Board notification

Adding a new PMC member requires sending an email notification to the Board's mailing list copying the PMC's private mailing list and waiting 72 hours. Once the notification appears in the archives, an invitation may be sent out 72 hours later (unless a Director objects to the nomination). The detailed process can be found in the June 2013 board minutes under section "7 G. Amend the Procedure for PMC Membership Changes"

**Do NOT send an unconditional invite to the potential member before the 72 hour NOTICE period has expired!** It would be very awkward if the invite has to be withdrawn if the board objects.

This notification may be sent by the PMC Chair, or by any other PMC member if they include a link to the formal PMC decision or vote on their private@ list.

Ensure the PMC private list is copied - but do not Cc the potential member. For example:

```text
To: board@apache.org
Cc: private@juneau.apache.org
[NOTICE] Jane Doe for Juneau PMC

Juneau proposes to invite [Jane Doe] (janedoe) to join the PMC.

(include if a vote was held)
The vote result is available here: https://lists.apache.org/...
```

**It should noted that there is a grace period of 72 hours from when the above NOTICE is sent to the board to when the proposed member is formally invited. This is an important part of the overall process. Failure to do this can result in an embarrassing situation for people involved.**

## PMC Invite

After 72 hours, Jane Doe should be invited to join the PMC. Check to see if the proposed committer already has an Apache id.

### Sample message for proposed committers without an Apache id:

```text
To: janedoe@gmail.com
Cc: private@juneau.apache.org
Subject: You're invited to join the Juneau PMC!

Hello [Jane Doe],

The Juneau Project Management Committee (PMC) hereby offers you committer privileges to the project as well as membership in the PMC. These privileges are offered on the understanding that you'll use them reasonably and with common sense. We like to work on trust rather than unnecessary constraints.

Being a committer enables you to more easily make changes without needing to go through the patch submission process. Being a PMC member enables you to guide the direction of the project.

Being a committer does not require you to participate any more than you already do. It does tend to make one even more committed. You will probably find that you spend more time here.

Of course, you can decline and instead remain as a contributor, participating as you do now.

A. This personal invitation is a chance for you to accept or decline in private. Either way, please let us know in reply to the private@juneau.apache.org address only.

B. If you accept, the next step is to register an iCLA if you do not have an Apache id.

If you have an Apache id, let the PMC know by return email what your id is.

1. If you do not have an Apache id, details of the iCLA and the forms are found here:
   http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas

2. Instructions for its completion and return to the Secretary of the ASF are found here:
   http://www.apache.org/licenses/#submitting

3. When you transmit the completed iCLA, request to notify the Apache Juneau and choose a unique Apache id. Look to see if your preferred id is already taken at http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html. This will allow the Secretary to notify the PMC when your iCLA has been recorded.

When recording of your iCLA is noticed, you will receive a follow-up message with the next steps for establishing you as a committer.
```

### Sample message for existing Apache committers:

```text

## PMC Accept

This is the followup email after the new committer has accepted the invitation.  

This message can be skipped for existing Apache committers.

### Message for new Apache committers:

```text

Subject: Re: invitation to become Juneau PMC member

Welcome. Here are the next steps. After that we will make an announcement to the juneau-dev list.

You need to have an Apache id. If you do not already have one, you will need to send an individual Contributor License Agreement to the ASF. If you also make contributions done in work time or using work resources then consult with your company to see if they want to file a corporate CLA. Ask us (the PMC) if you have any questions.

http://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas

You need to choose a preferred ASF user name and alternatives. In order to ensure it is available you can view a list of taken ids at

http://people.apache.org/committer-index.html

Please notify us when you have submitted the iCLA and by what means you did so. This will enable us to monitor its progress.

We will arrange for your Apache user account when the iCLA has been recorded.

After that is done, please make followup replies to the dev@juneau.apache.org list. We generally discuss everything there and keep the private@juneau.apache.org list for occasional matters which must be private.

Most important links for developers can be found here:

http://juneau.apache.org/index.html#community.html

The developer section of the Apache website describes the roles and provides other resources:

http://www.apache.org/foundation/how-it-works.html
http://www.apache.org/dev/

Just as before you became a committer, participation in any ASF community requires adherence to the ASF Code of Conduct:

https://www.apache.org/foundation/policies/conduct.html

Best regards,
The Apache Juneau PMC
```
