title: How non-committers can contribute code
---

This guide is for those who are new to Juneau and want to contribute code, specifically those who do not have write access to our repositories:
- [https://github.com/apache/juneau](https://github.com/apache/juneau)
- [https://github.com/apache/juneau-website](https://github.com/apache/juneau-website)

## Step-by-step guide

1. **Create a fork** of the repository you want to contribute to - [https://github.com/apache/juneau](https://github.com/apache/juneau) or [https://github.com/apache/juneau-website](https://github.com/apache/juneau-website) - the fork button is in the top right corner

2. **Clone your fork** of the repository locally
3. **Make changes** to your local clone. If you haven't already, create a JIRA issue.
4. **Commit them locally**, using the commit format of `"JIRA-TICKET - What you changed"` e.g. `"JUNEAU-123 - Made JUNEAU better."`
5. **Push these changes** to your fork
6. **Navigate back** to your fork or to our github repositories and you'll see an option to create a new pull request.
7. **Click on the blue link "Pull request"** to bring up the create pull request screen.
8. **After you've filled out a title and description**, click on the green "Create pull request" button.
