title: "@NameProperty Annotation"

The <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/annotation/NameProperty.html" target="_blank">@NameProperty</a> annotation is used to identify a setter method or field for setting the name of a POJO as it's known by its parent object.

This annotation is used by parsers to automatically set the name/key of an object when parsing structured data (e.g., JSON maps, XML elements). A common use case is when parsing a map where the map key should be stored as a property on the bean.

## Requirements

- Must be an **instance** method or field (not static)
- For methods: Must accept exactly one parameter (any type)
- For fields: Can be any type
- The method or field does not need to be public (will be made accessible automatically)

## Usage

Can be applied to:
- Bean setter methods or fields
- `@Rest`-annotated classes and `@RestOp`-annotated methods when using the `on()` parameter

## Example

### Using a Field

```js
// JSON being parsed:
{
    "id1": {name: "John Smith", sex: "M"},
    "id2": {name: "Jane Doe", sex: "F"}
}
```

```java
public class Person {
    @NameProperty
    public String id;  // Gets set to "id1" or "id2" from map key

    public String name;
    public char sex;
}
```

### Using a Setter Method

```java
public class Person {
    private String id;

    @NameProperty
    protected void setName(String name) {
        this.id = name;
    }

    public String name;
    public char sex;
}
```

## When It's Called

- During parsing when an object is created as a value in a map/collection
- The parser automatically calls the setter or sets the field with the key/name from the parent structure
- This allows the bean to know its key/name within the parent container
