This script scans the Juneau codebase to find missing fluent setter overrides in subclasses.

## Problem

Juneau uses fluent-style setters extensively for method chaining:

```java
public class X {
    public X setY(Y y) {
        this.y = y;
        return this;
    }
}
```

When a class extends another class with fluent setters, it should override those setters to return the correct subclass type:

```java
public class X2 extends X {
    @Override 
    public X2 setY(Y y) {
        super.setY(y);
        return this;
    }
}
```

## What It Does

The script:
1. Scans all Java files in the codebase
2. Identifies classes with fluent setters
3. Checks subclasses for proper overrides
4. Reports missing or incorrect overrides

## Usage

```bash
cd /Users/james.bognar/git/juneau
python3 scripts/check-fluent-setter-overrides.py
```

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external Python dependencies (uses only standard library)

## Notes

- The script helps maintain type safety in fluent APIs
- Missing overrides can cause type casting issues in method chains
- Reports are printed to stdout with file locations and line numbers
