`check-topic-links.py` validates that all documentation topic links in the Juneau source code are correct and point to valid topics with matching titles.

## What It Does

The script performs three main operations:

1. **Extracts Topic Information** - Scans `/docs/pages/topics` for all markdown files and extracts:
   - Slug names from the frontmatter
   - Page titles from the frontmatter

2. **Finds Topic Links** - Scans the entire Juneau source tree for links in the format:
   ```
   https://juneau.apache.org/docs/topics/SLUG">TITLE</a>
   ```

3. **Validates Links** - Reports any issues:
   - **Title mismatches**: Link title doesn't match the actual topic title
   - **Unknown slugs**: Link points to a topic that doesn't exist

## Usage

### Check all topic links

```bash
cd /Users/james.bognar/git/juneau
python3 scripts/check-topic-links.py
```

The script will automatically:
- Scan `/docs/pages/topics` for topic definitions
- Scan the entire Juneau source tree for topic links
- Report any issues found

## File Types Scanned

The script checks the following file types:
- `.java` - Java source files
- `.md` - Markdown files
- `.xml` - XML configuration files
- `.properties` - Properties files
- `.txt` - Text files
- `.adoc` - AsciiDoc files
- `.rst` - reStructuredText files

## Exit Codes

- `0` - Success, all links validated
- `1` - Error occurred or validation issues found

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- No external Python dependencies (uses only standard library)

## Notes

- The script is typically run as part of `build-docs.py`
- It validates both slug names and title text
- Reports are printed to stdout with file locations and line numbers
