`maven-version.py` extracts the Maven major version number from the output of `mvn -version`.

## What It Does

The script:
1. Runs `mvn -version`
2. Parses the output to extract the major version number
3. Prints the major version (e.g., "3") to stdout

## Usage

```bash
python3 scripts/maven-version.py
```

## Output

Prints the major version number (e.g., "3") to stdout.

### Example

```bash
$ python3 scripts/maven-version.py
3
```

## Exit Codes

- `0` - Success, version printed to stdout
- `1` - Error, could not determine Maven version or Maven not found

## Use Cases

This script is typically used by other scripts (like `release.py`) to:
- Check if Maven meets minimum version requirements
- Verify Maven installation

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Maven (mvn command must be in PATH)
- No external Python dependencies (uses only standard library)

## Notes

- The script looks for patterns like "Apache Maven 3.9.5" or "Maven 3.9.5"
- Returns only the major version number (e.g., "3" from "3.9.5")
- Exits with error if Maven is not found or version cannot be parsed
