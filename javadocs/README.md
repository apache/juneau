# Javadocs Directory

This directory contains versioned Javadoc documentation for Apache Juneau releases.

## Structure

Each version of Juneau has its own subdirectory:

```
javadocs/
├── latest/           (symlink or copy to current stable version)
├── 9.2.0/
├── 9.1.0/
├── 9.0.1/
├── 9.0.0/
├── 8.2.0/
└── ...
```

## Adding New Javadocs

To add javadocs for a new version:

1. Create a directory for the version:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p static/javadocs/X.Y.Z
   ```

2. Copy the generated javadocs into the version directory:
   ```bash
   cp -r /path/to/generated/apidocs/* static/javadocs/X.Y.Z/
   ```

3. Update the `latest` symlink (or copy) to point to the newest stable version:
   ```bash
   rm -f static/javadocs/latest
   ln -s X.Y.Z static/javadocs/latest
   ```
   
   Or if symlinks don't work in your deployment:
   ```bash
   rm -rf static/javadocs/latest
   cp -r static/javadocs/X.Y.Z static/javadocs/latest
   ```

## Accessing Javadocs

After deployment, javadocs will be available at:

- Latest version: `https://juneau.apache.org/javadocs/latest/`
- Specific version: `https://juneau.apache.org/javadocs/X.Y.Z/`

## Integration with Website

To add links to these javadocs in the website navigation:

1. Update `docusaurus.config.ts` to include a dropdown for javadoc versions
2. Add links in relevant documentation pages to specific version javadocs
3. Consider adding a javadocs landing page at `src/pages/javadocs.md` that lists all available versions

## Git Considerations

**Important**: Javadoc HTML files can be quite large (tens of MBs). Consider:

- Using Git LFS (Large File Storage) for javadoc directories
- Storing javadocs in a separate repository or artifact storage
- Only committing the most recent 2-3 versions to git

If javadocs are too large for git, store them elsewhere and copy them during the build/deployment process.

## Current Status

- Current live javadocs: `/site/apidocs/` (generated by Maven site)
- Historical javadocs: This directory (static versioned copies)
