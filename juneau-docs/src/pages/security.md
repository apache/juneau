### Analysis Results
- [**GitHub CodeQL Analysis →**](https://github.com/apache/juneau/security/code-scanning) - Security vulnerability detection
- [**SonarCloud Quality Analysis →**](https://sonarcloud.io/summary/new_code?id=apache_juneau) - Code quality, security, and maintainability

## About Our Analysis Tools

### GitHub CodeQL

We use [GitHub CodeQL](https://codeql.github.com/) for automated security analysis. CodeQL is GitHub's semantic code analysis engine that helps identify:

- **Security vulnerabilities** - Potential security issues in your code
- **Bugs and errors** - Logic errors and potential runtime issues  
- **Code quality issues** - Patterns that could lead to problems

### SonarCloud

We use [SonarCloud](https://sonarcloud.io/) for comprehensive code quality analysis. SonarCloud provides:

- **Code quality metrics** - Maintainability, reliability, and security ratings
- **Technical debt analysis** - Time to fix code quality issues
- **Code coverage integration** - Test coverage analysis with JaCoCo
- **Security hotspot detection** - Potential security vulnerabilities
- **Code smell detection** - Anti-patterns and maintainability issues
- **Duplication analysis** - Code duplication detection

## Analysis Schedule

Our security and quality analysis runs automatically:

- **CodeQL**: Every Thursday at 3:15 AM UTC
- **SonarCloud**: Every Monday at 2:00 AM UTC
- **On every push** to the master branch
- **On every pull request** to the master branch
- **Languages analyzed**: Java

## Security Reporting

If you discover a security vulnerability in Apache Juneau, please report it responsibly:

### For Critical Security Issues

**Do not** report critical security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues. Instead:

1. **Email**: Send details to [security@apache.org](mailto:security@apache.org)
2. **Include**: 
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact assessment
   - Suggested fix (if available)

### For Non-Critical Issues

For non-critical security concerns or code quality issues:

1. **GitHub Issues**: Create a new issue in our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/apache/juneau/issues)
2. **Label**: Use the "security" label if available
3. **Description**: Provide clear steps to reproduce and expected behavior

## Security Best Practices

When using Apache Juneau in your applications:

- **Keep updated**: Always use the latest stable release
- **Review dependencies**: Regularly check for vulnerable dependencies
- **Input validation**: Validate all external inputs
- **Error handling**: Implement proper error handling and logging
- **Configuration**: Use secure default configurations

## Dependencies

We regularly monitor our dependencies for known vulnerabilities:

- **Maven dependencies**: Automatically checked during builds
- **Security alerts**: GitHub automatically notifies us of vulnerable dependencies
- **Regular updates**: Dependencies are updated regularly in new releases

## Contact

For security-related questions or concerns:

- **Email**: [dev@juneau.apache.org](mailto:dev@juneau.apache.org)
- **Mailing list**: [Subscribe to our dev mailing list](https://juneau.apache.org/mailing-lists.html)
