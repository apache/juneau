## About the Apache Software Foundation

The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is a US 501(c)(3) non-profit corporation founded in 1999 to provide organizational, legal, and financial support for a broad range of open source software projects. The ASF provides an established framework for intellectual property and financial contributions that simultaneously limits contributors' potential legal exposure.

All Apache projects are characterized by a collaborative, consensus-based development process and an open and pragmatic software license that makes it easy for anyone to use Apache software products. The Apache License does not require any royalty payments, and it allows the code to be redistributed under certain conditions without concern for royalties or restrictive licensing terms.
