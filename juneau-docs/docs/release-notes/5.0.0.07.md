### Core API updates

- Combined previous 3 libraries into a single library.

  Adds ability to find and process unknown bean properties during parsing.

- Enhancements to <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/xml/XmlParser.html" target="_blank">XmlParser</a>:
  - Coalescing support
  - Validations support
  - Support for replacing entity references
  - Resolver support
  - Event allocator support
  - Trim-whitespace support

- Enhanced XML support:
  - New <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/xml/annotation/Xml.html#format()" target="_blank">@Xml.format</a> annotation.
    Controls how POJOs get serialized to XML.
    Also allows you to collapse collections and arrays.
  - New `@Xml.namespaces` annotation.
    Namespaces can be defined at package, class, method, or field levels.
  - New `@Xml.nsUri` annotation.
    Shortcut for specifying namespace URIs.
  - New `@Xml.valAttr` annotation.
    Serializes a bean property value as an attribute.
  - Ability to override XS and XSI namespaces on XML and RDF/XML serializers.
  - Ability to override RDF namespace on RDF/XML serializer.
  - New more-efficient namespace resolution.

- New configurable property classes for everything are now structured better and easier to locate and identify through
  the following new classes:
  - <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/BeanContext.html" target="_blank">BeanContext</a>
  -  ~~SerializerContext~~
  -  ~~ParserContext~~

- Enhancements to <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/BeanContext.html" target="_blank">BeanContext</a>:
  - Ability to mark bean properties as hidden using ~~@BeanProperty(hidden)~~ so that they don't get serialized.
  - Simplified `ClassType` <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/ClassMeta.html" target="_blank">ClassMeta</a> API.
    Combined 4 classes into a single class.
  - New ~~@Bean.filter~~ and ~~@BeanProperty.filter~~ annotations.
    Used for defining filters on bean classes and bean properties instead of just globally through
    `BeanContext.addTransforms(Class[])`.
  - New <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/PropertyNamer.html" target="_blank">PropertyNamer</a> API /
    <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html#propertyNamer()" target="_blank">@Bean.propertyNamer</a> annotation.
    Used for customizing bean property names.
  - New ~~@BeanProperty.beanUri~~ and ~~@BeanProperty.id~~ annotations.
    Used for associating beans with URLs and IDs.
    Used by XML serializer to add a url attribute on a bean element.
    Used by RDF/XML serializer to construct `rdf:resource` attributes.
  - New ~~BeanProperty.properties()~~ annotation.
    Used for limiting properties on child elements.

- Automatic support for <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/net/URL.html" target="_blank">URL</a> and <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/net/URI.html" target="_blank">URI</a> objects.
  - Converted to hrefs in HTML.
  - Converted to url attributes in XML.
  - Converted to resource:about attributes in RDF/XML.

- Improvements to Javadocs.

- Improved  ~~PojoQuery~~ support.

### REST client updates

- GZIP compression support.

- Bug fixes.

### REST server updates

- Support for overriding bean context and serializer properties in a REST method call through new
  ~~RestResponse.setProperty(String,Object)~~ method.
  For example, allows you to control whitespace options on a per-request basis.

- Several new annotations on REST servlets:
  - ~~@RestResource.filters~~ - Associate post-formatting filters on a resource level.
  - ~~@RestResource.guards~~ - Associate resource-level guards.
  - ~~@RestResource.messages~~ - Associate a resource bundle with a REST servlet.
    Comes with several convenience methods for looking up messages for the client locale.
  - ~~@RestResource.properties~~ - Override default bean context, serializer, and parser properties though an
    annotation.

- Several new annotations on REST methods:
  - `@RestMethod(filters)` - Associate post-formatting filters on a method level.
  - ~~@RestMethod(guards)~~ - Associate method-level guards.

- New annotations on REST method parameters with automatic conversion:
  - ~~@Attr~~ - A parameter or URL variable value as a parsed POJO.
  - ~~@Param~~ - A query parameter value as a parsed POJO.
  - ~~@PathRemainder~~ - The remainder after a URL pattern match as a `String`.
  - ~~@Header~~ - An HTTP header value as a parsed POJO.
  - ~~@Content~~ - The HTTP content as a parsed POJO.
  - <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Method.html" target="_blank">@Method</a> - The HTTP method name as a `String`.

- HTTP response content POJOs can now simply be returned from methods instead of calling
  ~~RestResponse.setOutput(Object)~~.
