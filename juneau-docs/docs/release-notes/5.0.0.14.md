# Release 5.0.0.14

**Date:** Mar 23, 2013

Juno 5.0.0.14 is a major update.

The biggest change is that the `RestSerializer`, `RestParser`, `RestSerializerGroup`, and `RestParserGroup` classes have
been eliminated entirely.
Instead, the existing <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/serializer/Serializer.html" target="_blank">Serializer</a>,
<a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/parser/Parser.html" target="_blank">Parser</a>,  ~~SerializerGroup~~, and  ~~ParserGroup~~ classes of the
core API have been augmented to replace them.

Adoptions will be required if you have previously used these classes.

### Core API changes

- New `org.apache.juneau.serializer` package.
  - Entirely reworked class hierarchy to make it easier to define new serializers.
  - New <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/serializer/WriterSerializer.html" target="_blank">WriterSerializer</a> base class for defining
    character-based serializers.
  - New <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/serializer/OutputStreamSerializer.html" target="_blank">OutputStreamSerializer</a> base class for
    defining byte-based serializers.
  - Updated  ~~SerializerGroup~~ class with full support for RFC2616 `Accept-Content` headers.
  - Improved cloning support on serializers and serializer groups.

- New `org.apache.juneau.parser` package.
  - Entirely reworked class hierarchy to make it easier to define new parsers.
  - New <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/parser/ReaderParser.html" target="_blank">ReaderParser</a> base class for defining
    character-based parsers.
  - New <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/parser/InputStreamParser.html" target="_blank">InputStreamParser</a> base class for defining
    byte-based parsers.
  - Improved cloning support on parsers and parser groups.

- New `org.apache.juneau.swap` package.
  - Cleaner class structure.
  - Improved  ~~BeanFilter~~ class for defining property filters on beans.
  - Improved  ~~PojoQuery~~ class for defining filters on objects (previously called `ObjectFilter`).

- New `org.apache.juneau.encoders` package.
  - Defines API for <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/encoders/Encoder.html" target="_blank">Encoders</a> for enabling compression in REST
    servlets and clients.
  - Previously, gzip compression was enabled by default.
    This new API allows you to plug in your own compression algorithms.
  - New <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/encoders/GzipEncoder.html" target="_blank">GzipEncoder</a> class for enabling gzip compression.
  - New ~~EncoderGroup~~ class for managing multiple encoders and finding them based on RFC2616 `Accept-Encoding`
    header values.

- New `org.apache.juneau.plaintext` package.
  - New <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/plaintext/PlainTextSerializer.html" target="_blank">PlainTextSerializer</a> and
    <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/plaintext/PlainTextParser.html" target="_blank">PlainTextParser</a> classes for
    serializing/parsing text/plain content.

- New `org.apache.juneau.jso` package.
  - New ~~JsoSerializer~~ class for serializing `application/x-java-serialized-object` content.

- New `org.apache.juneau.soap` package.
  - New <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/soap/SoapXmlSerializer.html" target="_blank">SoapXmlSerializer</a> class for serializing
    `text/xml+soap` content.

- Improved cloning support on the <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/BeanContext.html" target="_blank">BeanContext</a> class.
  - Better caching. Improved caching performance.

- `JsonMap` and `JsonList` changed to  ~~ObjectMap~~ and  ~~ObjectList~~ to better reflect that they're not limited
  to just JSON support.

- Renamed `PojoSwap` to  ~~PojoQuery~~ to not confuse it with the new Filter API.

### REST server API changes

- Eliminated `org.apache.juneau.rest.serializers` and `org.apache.juneau.rest.parsers` packages.
  - All existing REST serializers and parsers merged into the core API.

### REST client API changes

- Simplified <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient.html" target="_blank">RestClient</a> API.
  - You can now only specify a single serializer or parser per client. This significantly simplifies the code.
  - Support for <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/encoders/Encoder.html" target="_blank">Encoders</a>.

- Eliminated `RestCmdLine` (since it's essentially redundant with CURL).
