# Release 5.0.0.36

**Date:** Dec 18, 2013

Juno 5.0.0.36 is a minor update.

- Implemented `org.apache.juneau.urlencoding.UrlEncodingParser.parseArgs(Reader,int,ClassMeta[])`.
- `name` parameter of ~~ResourceDescription.ResourceDescription(String,String,String)~~ is now automatically URL-encoded so that the name can contain special characters (e.g. `foo/bar(baz)`).
- Support for URL-matching and path info containing encoded characters (e.g. '/') now supported.
- Removed some lazy-initialization of bean information in [ClassMeta](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/ClassMeta.html) that allowed the removal of some synchronized blocks.
- Improved support of ~~BeanContext.getClassMetaFromString(String)~~.
  Now supports primitive arrays such as "long[]" in addition to the previous support for the equivalent "[J".
- Various new convenience methods added to ~~StringUtils~~ and ~~ClassUtils~~.s
