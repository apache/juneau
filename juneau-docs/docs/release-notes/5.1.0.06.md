# Release 5.1.0.6

**Date:** Sept 21, 2014

Juno 5.1.0.6 is a moderate update.

- Simplified API for  ~~PojoSwap~~.
  Since it's rarely used, the `beanContext` parameter was replaced with a ~~PojoSwap.getBeanContext()~~ method on the
  class.

- New simplified way of defining POJO filters without needing to extend  ~~PojoSwap~~.
  See  ~~SurrogateSwap~~ for details.

- New <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/annotation/Html.html" target="_blank">@Html</a> annotation.
  Will allow the definition of standard XHTML DTOs in future releases.
  For now,  ~~Img~~ is an example of defining an XHTML element using Juno DTOs.

- <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/json/JsonParser.html" target="_blank">JsonParser</a> now ignores trailing `';'` characters in input so that it can parse strings of the form `"var x = {'foo':'bar'};"`

- New `TumblrParserResource` in the samples war file showing how to combine the REST client and server APIs into a single resource in order to download Tumblr blogs and convert the response into any supported response content type.
