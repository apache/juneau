# Release 7.0.1

**Date:** Dec 24, 2017

This release is a minor update.
It includes the following prereq updates:

- Apache HttpClient: 4.5.3 to 4.5.4
- Eclipse Jetty: 9.4.6.v20170531 to 9.4.8.v20171121

### juneau-marshall

- New static `create()` methods for builders on serializers and parsers.
  This simplifies the syntax of creation of serializers and parsers by scratch.

  ```java
  // Old way
  JsonSerializer s1 = new JsonSerializer.Builder().ws().build();
  
  // New way
  JsonSerializer s2 = JsonSerializer.create().ws().build();
  ```

  The same static create methods have also been added to the following classes:

  - ~~SerializerGroup.create()~~
  - ~~ParserGroup.create()~~
  - ~~EncoderGroup.create()~~
  - [RestClient.create()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient.html#create())
  - ~~ConfigFile.create()~~

- The order of the parameters in [SerializerSession.serialize(Object,Object)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/serializer/SerializerSession.html#serialize(Object,Object)) has been changed to match [Serializer.serialize(Object,Object)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/serializer/Serializer.html#serialize(Object,Object)).

- Fixed some bugs in the XML parser related to whitespace and comments.

### juneau-svl

- New methods on <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/svl/Var.html" target="_blank">Var</a> class to restrict when nested and embedded
  variables are resolved.

  - [Var.allowNested()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/svl/Var.html#allowNested())
  - [Var.allowRecurse()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/svl/Var.html#allowRecurse())

### juneau-rest-server

- New ~~@RestResource(maxInput)~~ and ~~@RestMethod(maxInput)~~ for alleviating potential DoS attacks.

### juneau-microservice-server

- New pluggable console commands.
  When you start up the microservice, you'll now see the following:

  ```text
  Running class 'RestMicroservice' using config file 'examples.cfg'.
  Server started on port 10000

  List of available commands:
      exit -- Shut down service
      restart -- Restarts service
      help -- Commands help
      echo -- Echo command

  > help help
  NAME
      help -- Commands help
  
  SYNOPSIS
      help [command]
  
  DESCRIPTION
      When called without arguments, prints the descriptions of all available commands.
      Can also be called with one or more arguments to get detailed information on a command.
  
  EXAMPLES
      List all commands:
          > help
      
      List help on the help command:
          > help help
              
  > 
  ```

  Commands are pluggable and extensible through the config file.

  ```ini
  #=======================================================================================================================
  # Console settings
  #=======================================================================================================================
  [Console]
  
  enabled = true
  
  # List of available console commands.
  # These are classes that implements ConsoleCommand that allow you to submit commands to the microservice via
  # the console.
  # When listed here, the implementations must provide a no-arg constructor.
  # They can also be provided dynamically by overriding the Microservice.createConsoleCommands() method.
  commands = 
      org.apache.juneau.microservice.console.ExitCommand,
      org.apache.juneau.microservice.console.RestartCommand,
      org.apache.juneau.microservice.console.HelpCommand
  ```
