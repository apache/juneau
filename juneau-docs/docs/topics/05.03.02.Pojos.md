Entries can also be read as POJOs.

In theory, any [parsable](/docs/topics/PojoCategories) POJO type can be represented as a config value.
However in practice, we're typically talking about the following:

- Objects convertible from Strings.
- Beans.

An example of an object convertible from a String was already shown in an example above.
In that case, it was a URL which has a public constructor that takes in a String:

```ini
# A POJO
key4 = http://bar
```

```java
// Read values from section #1
URL key4 = config.get("Section1/key4").as(URL.class).orElse(null);
```

Beans are represented as [JSON 5](/docs/topics/Json5Basics) by default:

```ini
// Contact information
[ContactInfo]
address =
    {
        street: '123 Main Street',
        city: 'Anywhere',
        state: 'NY',
        zip: 12345
    }
```

```java
// Example bean
public class Address {
    public String street, city;
    public StateEnum state;
    public int zip;
}

// Example usage
Config config = Config.create("MyConfig.cfg").build();
Address myAddress = config.get("ContactInfo/address").as(Address.class).orElse(null);
```

The default serializer and parser is registered on the Config through the following methods:
