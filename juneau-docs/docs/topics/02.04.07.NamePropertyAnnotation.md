The <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/annotation/NameProperty.html" target="_blank">@NameProperty</a> annotation is used to identify a setter
as a method for setting the name of a POJO as it's known by its parent object.

A commonly-used case is when you're parsing a JSON map containing beans where one of the bean properties is the key used
in the map.

```js
// JSON
{
    id1: {name: 'John Smith', sex: 'M'},
    id2: {name: 'Jane Doe', sex: 'F'}
}
```

```java
public class Person {

    @NameProperty
    public String id;  // Value gets assigned from object key

    public String name;

    public char sex;
}
```
