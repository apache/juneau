slug: JuneauShadedOverview
---

Juneau provides **shaded (uber) JAR artifacts** that bundle multiple Juneau modules into single JAR files. These artifacts simplify dependency management and are especially useful for build systems like Bazel that require explicit dependency declarations.

## What Are Shaded Artifacts?

Shaded artifacts use the [Maven Shade Plugin](https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-shade-plugin/) to:
- Bundle multiple Juneau modules into a single JAR
- Merge service provider files automatically
- Eliminate the need to declare transitive Juneau dependencies
- Maintain all original functionality without modification

**Important**: Shaded artifacts only bundle Juneau modules. External dependencies (like Apache HttpClient, Jakarta Servlet API, etc.) must still be declared separately.

## Available Shaded Artifacts

## When to Use Shaded Artifacts

### ✅ Use Shaded Artifacts When:

- **Using Bazel or similar build systems** - These require explicit dependency declarations; shaded artifacts simplify this significantly
- **Wanting simplified dependency management** - One dependency instead of many
- **Building standalone applications** - Uber JARs are convenient for deployment
- **Getting started quickly** - Fewer decisions about which modules to include

### ❌ Consider Individual Modules When:

- **Building a library** - Other projects may need fine-grained control over dependencies
- **Minimizing JAR size** - Individual modules allow excluding unused functionality
- **Avoiding classpath conflicts** - In complex applications with many dependencies
- **Needing different module versions** - Though this is rarely necessary

## Quick Start

### Maven

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.juneau</groupId>
    <artifactId>juneau-shaded-all</artifactId>
    <version>${juneau.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

### Bazel

```python
maven_jar(
    name = "juneau_all",
    artifact = "org.apache.juneau:juneau-shaded-all:${juneau.version}",
)
```

## Why Shaded Artifacts for Bazel?

Bazel enforces **strict dependency management** where you must explicitly declare every direct dependency your code uses. Unlike Maven, which automatically resolves transitive dependencies, Bazel requires you to know and declare all dependencies.

### The Problem with Regular Juneau in Bazel

When using regular Juneau modules in Bazel:

```python
# This is incomplete and will fail!
maven_jar(
    name = "juneau_marshall",
    artifact = "org.apache.juneau:juneau-marshall:9.2.0-SNAPSHOT",
)

java_library(
    name = "my_lib",
    srcs = ["MyCode.java"],
    deps = ["@juneau_marshall//jar"],  # Missing juneau-commons!
)
```

**Problem**: Your code can't compile because `juneau-marshall` depends on `juneau-commons`, but you didn't declare it.

### Solution with Shaded Artifacts

Just one dependency declaration!

```python
maven_jar(
    name = "juneau_core",
    artifact = "org.apache.juneau:juneau-shaded-core:9.2.0-SNAPSHOT",
)

java_library(
    name = "my_lib",
    srcs = ["MyCode.java"],
    deps = ["@juneau_core//jar"],  # Everything included!
)
```

## Complete Bazel Examples

### Example 1: REST Client

**Scenario**: Build a REST client application.

**WORKSPACE**:
```python
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

# Add Maven dependencies
maven_jar(
    name = "juneau_rest_client",
    artifact = "org.apache.juneau:juneau-shaded-rest-client:9.2.0-SNAPSHOT",
    repository = "https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/",
)

    srcs = ["MyRestClient.java"],
    deps = [
        "@juneau_rest_client//jar",
        "@httpclient5//jar",
        "@httpcore5//jar",
    ],
    main_class = "com.example.MyRestClient",
)
```

### Example 2: REST Server

**Scenario**: Build a REST server application.

**WORKSPACE**:

    artifact = "org.eclipse.jetty:jetty-server:12.0.5",
)
```

**BUILD**:
```python
java_library(
    name = "my_rest_server",
    srcs = ["MyRestServer.java"],
    deps = [
        "@juneau_rest_server//jar",
        "@jakarta_servlet_api//jar",
        "@jetty_server//jar",
    ],
)
```

### Example 3: Spring Boot Integration

**Scenario**: Build a Spring Boot + Juneau application.

**WORKSPACE**:
```python
maven_jar(
    name = "juneau_rest_server_springboot",
    artifact = "org.apache.juneau:juneau-shaded-rest-server-springboot:9.2.0-SNAPSHOT",
    repository = "https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/",
)

maven_jar(
    name = "spring_boot_starter_web",
    artifact = "org.springframework.boot:spring-boot-starter-web:3.2.0",
)
```

**BUILD**:
```python
java_library(
    name = "my_spring_app",
    srcs = glob(["src/**/*.java"]),
    deps = [
        "@juneau_rest_server_springboot//jar",
        "@spring_boot_starter_web//jar",
    ],
)
```

### Example 4: Core Marshalling Only

**Scenario**: Use Juneau for JSON/XML/etc. serialization without REST features.

**WORKSPACE**:
```python
maven_jar(
    name = "juneau_core",
    artifact = "org.apache.juneau:juneau-shaded-core:9.2.0-SNAPSHOT",
    repository = "https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/",
)
```

**BUILD**:
```python
java_library(
    name = "my_serialization_lib",
    srcs = ["MySerializer.java"],
    deps = [
        "@juneau_core//jar",
    ],
)
```

### Example 5: Everything (Complete Framework)

**Scenario**: You want access to all Juneau features.

**WORKSPACE**:
```python
maven_jar(
    name = "juneau_all",
    artifact = "org.apache.juneau:juneau-shaded-all:9.2.0-SNAPSHOT",
    repository = "https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/",
)

# Still need external dependencies
maven_jar(
    name = "jakarta_servlet_api",
    artifact = "jakarta.servlet:jakarta.servlet-api:6.1.0",
)

maven_jar(
    name = "httpclient5",
    artifact = "org.apache.httpcomponents.client5:httpclient5:5.2.1",
)
```

**BUILD**:
```python
java_library(
    name = "my_full_app",
    srcs = glob(["src/**/*.java"]),
    deps = [
        "@juneau_all//jar",
        "@jakarta_servlet_api//jar",
        "@httpclient5//jar",
    ],
)
```

## Finding External Dependencies

Shaded JARs **only bundle Juneau modules**. External dependencies (like Apache HttpClient, Jakarta Servlet API, etc.) must still be declared separately.

### Method 1: Check the dependency-reduced-pom.xml

After building a shaded module, examine:
```bash
cat juneau-shaded/juneau-shaded-rest-client/dependency-reduced-pom.xml
```

This file lists all external dependencies that the shaded JAR still requires.

### Method 2: Use Maven dependency:tree

```bash
cd juneau-shaded/juneau-shaded-rest-client
mvn dependency:tree
```

### Method 3: Common External Dependencies

Here's a quick reference:

| Juneau Shaded Artifact | Common External Dependencies |
|------------------------|------------------------------|
| `juneau-shaded-core` | None |
| `juneau-shaded-rest-client` | `httpclient5`, `httpcore5` |
| `juneau-shaded-rest-server` | `jakarta.servlet-api`, `jetty-server` |
| `juneau-shaded-rest-server-springboot` | `spring-boot-starter-web`, `jakarta.servlet-api` |
| `juneau-shaded-all` | All of the above |

## Advanced: Using rules_jvm_external

For more sophisticated Bazel builds, use `rules_jvm_external`:

**WORKSPACE**:
```python
load("@bazel_tools//tools/build_defs/repo:http.bzl", "http_archive")

RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG = "5.3"
RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_SHA = "d31e369b854322ca5098ea12c69d7175ded971435e55c18dd9dd5f29cc5249ac"

http_archive(
    name = "rules_jvm_external",
    strip_prefix = "rules_jvm_external-%s" % RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG,
    sha256 = RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_SHA,
    url = "https://github.com/bazelbuild/rules_jvm_external/releases/download/%s/rules_jvm_external-%s.tar.gz" % (RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG, RULES_JVM_EXTERNAL_TAG),
)

load("@rules_jvm_external//:defs.bzl", "maven_install")

maven_install(
    artifacts = [
        "org.apache.juneau:juneau-shaded-rest-client:9.2.0-SNAPSHOT",
        "org.apache.httpcomponents.client5:httpclient5:5.2.1",
        "org.apache.httpcomponents.core5:httpcore5:5.2.1",
    ],
    repositories = [
        "https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/",
        "https://repo1.maven.org/maven2",
    ],
    fetch_sources = True,
)
```

**BUILD**:
```python
java_binary(
    name = "my_app",
    srcs = ["MyApp.java"],
    deps = [
        "@maven//:org_apache_juneau_juneau_shaded_rest_client",
        "@maven//:org_apache_httpcomponents_client5_httpclient5",
        "@maven//:org_apache_httpcomponents_core5_httpcore5",
    ],
    main_class = "com.example.MyApp",
)
```

## Bazel Troubleshooting

### Build fails with "package X does not exist"

**Cause**: You're missing an external dependency.

**Solution**: Check the `dependency-reduced-pom.xml` for the shaded module and add the missing dependency to your WORKSPACE.

### Conflicting versions of dependencies

**Cause**: Multiple artifacts depend on different versions of the same library.

**Solution**: Use `rules_jvm_external` with version resolution:

```python
maven_install(
    artifacts = [
        "org.apache.juneau:juneau-shaded-rest-client:9.2.0-SNAPSHOT",
        "org.apache.httpcomponents.client5:httpclient5:5.2.1",
    ],
    version_conflict_policy = "pinned",  # Use specific versions
)
```

### Shaded JAR is too large

**Cause**: You're using `juneau-shaded-all` when you only need a subset.

**Solution**: Use a more specific shaded artifact:
- For client only: `juneau-shaded-rest-client`
- For server only: `juneau-shaded-rest-server`
- For core only: `juneau-shaded-core`

## Bazel Best Practices

1. **Start with the smallest shaded artifact** that meets your needs
2. **Always check `dependency-reduced-pom.xml`** for external dependencies
3. **Use `rules_jvm_external`** for production Bazel builds
4. **Pin dependency versions** to ensure reproducible builds
5. **Document external dependencies** in your project's README

## Performance Considerations

### Build Time
- **Shaded JARs**: Faster builds due to fewer dependency declarations
- **Individual Modules**: More explicit control but slower due to transitive resolution

### Runtime
- No runtime difference between shaded and non-shaded artifacts
- Same classes, same performance characteristics

### JAR Size
- Shaded JARs are larger but self-contained
- For microservices, this is usually acceptable
- For libraries, consider using individual modules

## Architecture

The shaded modules form a dependency hierarchy:

```
juneau-shaded-core (2.1 MB)
    ↓
    ├─→ juneau-shaded-rest-client (3.8 MB)
    │
    └─→ juneau-shaded-rest-server (3.8 MB)
            ↓
            └─→ juneau-shaded-rest-server-springboot (3.8 MB)

juneau-shaded-all (4.0 MB)
    = juneau-shaded-rest-server-springboot
    + juneau-rest-client
    + all bean modules
    + all microservice modules
```

## Distribution

All shaded artifacts are included in the binary distribution under the `/shaded` directory:

```
apache-juneau-${version}-bin.zip
└── shaded/
    ├── juneau-shaded-core-${version}.jar
    ├── juneau-shaded-rest-client-${version}.jar
    ├── juneau-shaded-rest-server-${version}.jar
    ├── juneau-shaded-rest-server-springboot-${version}.jar
    └── juneau-shaded-all-${version}.jar
```
