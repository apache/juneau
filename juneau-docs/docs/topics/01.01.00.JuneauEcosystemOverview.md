#### About

Apache Juneau™ is a single cohesive Java ecosystem for marshalling Java objects to a wide variety of language types and 
creating annotation-based REST end-to-end server and client APIs.

#### Common Use Cases

Juneau excels in the following scenarios:

* **Marshalling Java beans to a variety of languages using zero dependencies** - Serialize POJOs to JSON, XML, HTML, URL-Encoding, UON, OpenAPI, PlainText, CSV, SOAP, MessagePack, and RDF formats with minimal setup
* **Creation of self-documenting Bean-based REST APIs for SpringBoot and Jetty applications** - Build REST services with automatic Swagger documentation, content negotiation, and POJO-based request/response handling
* **Creation of Java interface proxies on top of existing REST APIs** - Generate type-safe client proxies that make REST calls feel like local method invocations
* **Powerful INI-based configuration files** - Manage application configuration with support for POJOs, arrays, collections, binary data, and real-time file watching
* **Serverless unit testing of REST APIs** - Test REST services without servlet containers using MockRestClient for fast, comprehensive testing
* **Microservice development** - Build lightweight microservices with embedded Jetty or Spring Boot integration
* **Data transformation and mapping** - Convert between different data formats and handle complex object hierarchies with swap mechanisms
* **Bean-Centric Testing and fluent-style assertions** - Write readable test assertions with comprehensive validation capabilities using juneau-bct and juneau-assertions
* **Content negotiation and HTTP/2 support** - Handle multiple content types automatically with modern HTTP features

The current version of Juneau is `9.0.1`.

The easiest way to pull in the library is through the following maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.juneau</groupId>
    <artifactId>juneau-all</artifactId>
    <version>${juneau.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

If you would like to work with the bleeding-edge code, you can access the `9.0.2-SNAPSHOT` version through the 
following repository:

```xml
<pluginRepositories>
    <pluginRepository>
        <id>apache.snapshots</id>
        <url>http://repository.apache.org/snapshots/</url>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
            <updatePolicy>always</updatePolicy>
        </snapshots>
    </pluginRepository>
</pluginRepositories>
```

Each of the components are also packaged as stand-alone OSGi modules.
