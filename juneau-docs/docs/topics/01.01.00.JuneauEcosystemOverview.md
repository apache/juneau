#### About

Apache Juneau™ is a single cohesive Java ecosystem for marshalling Java objects to a wide variety of language types and 
creating annotation-based REST end-to-end server and client APIs.

#### Ecosystem

The Juneau ecosystem consists of the following parts:

The current version of Juneau is `9.1.0`.

The easiest way to pull in the library is through the following maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.juneau</groupId>
    <artifactId>juneau‑shaded‑all</artifactId>
    <version>${juneau.version}</version>
</dependency>
```

Or for Bazel:

```python
maven_jar(
    name = "juneau_all",
    artifact = "org.apache.juneau:juneau-shaded-all:${juneau.version}",
)
```

For more specific use cases, consider using one of the other shaded artifacts listed above, or individual modules from `juneau-core` and `juneau-rest`.

If you would like to work with the bleeding-edge code, you can access the `9.2.0-SNAPSHOT` version through the 
following repository:

```xml
<pluginRepositories>
    <pluginRepository>
        <id>apache.snapshots</id>
        <url>http://repository.apache.org/snapshots/</url>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
            <updatePolicy>always</updatePolicy>
        </snapshots>
    </pluginRepository>
</pluginRepositories>
```

Each of the components are also packaged as stand-alone OSGi modules.

:::note Features

- Fast memory-efficient serialization.
- Fast, safe, memory-efficient parsing. Parsers are not susceptible to deserialization attacks.
- KISS is our mantra! 
No auto-wiring. 
No code generation. 
No dependency injection. 
Just add it to your classpath and use it. 
Extremely simple unit testing!
- Enjoyable to use
- Tiny - ~1MB
- Exhaustively tested
- Lots of up-to-date documentation and examples
- Minimal library dependencies making it ideal for use in uber-jars.
- Built on top of Servlet and Apache HttpClient APIs that allow you to use the newest HTTP/2 features such as 
request/response multiplexing and server push.
- All modules work with Java 8 through at least 18.
