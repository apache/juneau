- Reuse instances of serializers and parsers whenever possible.  
They are designed to be thread safe and maintain internal caches of bean metadata to increase performance.

- The [BeanTraverseContext.Builder.detectRecursions()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/BeanTraverseContext/Builder.html#detectRecursions()) option can cause a performance penalty of around 20%.
Therefore, it's recommended that this option be used only when necessary.

- In general, JSON serialization and parsing is about 20% faster than XML.
JSON is also more compact than XML.
MessagePack is fastest and most compact of all.

- The RDF parsers are SLOW.
RDF simply isn't efficient with node traversal, so creating tree structures out of RDF models is highly inefficient.

- The [Parser](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/parser/Parser.html) methods that take in [ClassMeta](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/ClassMeta.html) parameters are slightly faster than methods that take in [Class](API_DOCS/java/lang/Class.html) or [Object](API_DOCS/java/lang/Object.html) parameters, since the latter methods involve hash lookups to resolve to [ClassMeta](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/ClassMeta.html) parameters.
