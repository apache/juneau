- Reuse instances of serializers and parsers whenever possible.  
They are designed to be thread safe and maintain internal caches of bean metadata to increase performance.

- The <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/BeanTraverseContext.Builder.html#detectRecursions()" target="_blank">BeanTraverseContext.Builder.detectRecursions()</a> option can cause a performance penalty of around 20%.
Therefore, it's recommended that this option be used only when necessary.

- In general, JSON serialization and parsing is about 20% faster than XML.
JSON is also more compact than XML.
MessagePack is fastest and most compact of all.

- The RDF parsers are SLOW.
RDF simply isn't efficient with node traversal, so creating tree structures out of RDF models is highly inefficient.

- The <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/parser/Parser.html" target="_blank">Parser</a> methods that take in <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/ClassMeta.html" target="_blank">ClassMeta</a> parameters are slightly faster than methods that take in <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Class.html" target="_blank">Class</a> or <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/Object.html" target="_blank">Object</a> parameters, since the latter methods involve hash lookups to resolve to <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/ClassMeta.html" target="_blank">ClassMeta</a> parameters.
