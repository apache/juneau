## When to Use juneau-all

Use `juneau-all` when you want to:

- **Get started quickly** - Add one dependency and have access to all Juneau functionality
- **Build a complete application** - You need marshalling, REST server, and REST client capabilities
- **Simplify dependency management** - Avoid managing multiple individual Juneau dependencies

## When NOT to Use juneau-all

Consider using individual modules instead when you:

- **Want minimal dependencies** - Your application only needs specific Juneau functionality
- **Have size constraints** - The `juneau-all` JAR is larger than individual modules
- **Need specific versions** - You want to use different versions of individual modules

## Prerequisites

- **Servlet 3.1+** (for REST server functionality)
- **Apache HttpClient 4.5+** (for REST client functionality)
