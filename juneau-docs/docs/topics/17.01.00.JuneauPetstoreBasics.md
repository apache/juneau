The [PetStore](https://github.com/apache/juneau-petstore/blob/master/juneau-petstore-api/src/main/java/org/apache/juneau/petstore/PetStore.java) application is an functional application meant to demonstrate using Juneau with Spring Boot to create an
end-to-end client/server REST API.

What makes Juneau unique is the ability to create Java interfaces that behave just like RPC but using REST as the
underlying protocol.

And the technology it not tied to any platform so it can be used in any environment by simply pulling in Maven
dependencies.

The server-side need only provide the ability to host a servlet.

Visit the [GitHub project](https://github.com/apache/juneau-petstore) hosting the application.

The project is broken down into the following subprojects:
