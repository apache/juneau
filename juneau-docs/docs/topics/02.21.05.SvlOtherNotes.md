- The escape character `\` can be used when necessary to escape the following characters: `$ , { }`

It is possible to cause <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/17/docs/api/java.base/java/lang/StackOverflowError.html" target="_blank">StackOverflowErrors</a> if your nested variables
result in a recursive loop (e.g. the environment variable `'MYPROPERTY'` has the value `'$E{MYPROPERTY}'`).
So don't do that!

- As a general rule, this class tries to be as efficient as possible by not creating new strings when not needed.
  For example, calling the resolve method on a string that doesn't contain variables (e.g. `resolver.resolve("foobar")`)
  will simply be a no-op and return the same string.
