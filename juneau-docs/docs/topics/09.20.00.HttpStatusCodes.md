By default, a `200 (OK)` status is automatically set as the HTTP status when a Java method executes successfully.

Other status codes can be generated by throwing a <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/response/BasicHttpException.html" target="_blank">BasicHttpException</a> with a specific HTTP status code, or calling <a href="https://jakarta.ee/specifications/servlet/6.0/apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html#setStatus(int)" target="_blank">HttpServletResponse.setStatus(int)</a>.

Non-OK (200) status codes are automatically triggered by the following conditions:

| Code | Description | When triggered |
|------|-------------|----------------|
| 401 | Unauthorized | A <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/guard/RestGuard.html" target="_blank">org.apache.juneau.rest.guard</a> prevented the method from being executed |
| 404 | Not Found | No matching path patterns were found on any method |
| 405 | Method Not Implemented | A path pattern matched but no Java methods were found for the HTTP method |
| 406 | Not Acceptable | A path pattern matched but no Java methods were found with a matching serializer for the Accept on the request |
| 412 | Precondition Failed | A path pattern matched but no Java methods were found that were not rejected by <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/matcher/RestMatcher.html" target="_blank">org.apache.juneau.rest.matcher</a> |
| 415 | Unsupported Media Type | A path pattern matched but no Java methods were found with a matching parser for the Content-Type on the request |
| 500 | Internal Server Error | The Java method threw an exception other than <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/response/BasicHttpException.html" target="_blank">BasicHttpException</a> |
