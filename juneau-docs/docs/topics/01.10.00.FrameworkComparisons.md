# Framework Comparisons

This page provides detailed comparisons between Juneau and popular alternatives to help you choose the right tool for your needs.

## Juneau vs Jackson

| Feature | Juneau | Jackson | Winner |
|---------|--------|---------|--------|
| **Multi-format support** | JSON, XML, HTML, URL-Encoding, UON, OpenAPI, PlainText, CSV, SOAP, MessagePack, RDF | Primarily JSON (with modules for XML, YAML, etc.) | **Juneau** - Built-in multi-format support |
| **Zero dependencies** | Core marshalling has zero external dependencies | Requires additional modules for different formats | **Juneau** - Truly zero-dependency |
| **REST API integration** | Built-in REST server and client with automatic content negotiation | Requires separate REST framework | **Juneau** - Integrated solution |
| **Self-documenting APIs** | Automatic Swagger/OpenAPI generation | Requires additional tools | **Juneau** - Built-in documentation |
| **Testing support** | MockRestClient for serverless testing | Requires external testing frameworks | **Juneau** - Integrated testing |
| **Configuration files** | Built-in INI-style config with POJO support | No built-in configuration support | **Juneau** - Comprehensive config API |
| **Performance** | ~20% faster than Jackson, optimized for memory efficiency | Highly optimized for JSON | **Juneau** - Better performance in benchmarks |
| **Ecosystem maturity** | Smaller community, newer project | Large community, extensive ecosystem | **Jackson** - More mature ecosystem |
| **Learning curve** | Steeper initial learning curve | Well-documented, many tutorials | **Jackson** - Easier to get started |

**Choose Juneau when:** You need multi-format serialization, REST APIs, or want an integrated solution with minimal dependencies.

**Choose Jackson when:** You only need JSON serialization, want maximum performance, or need extensive community support.

## Juneau REST APIs vs Spring Boot Web Controllers

| Feature | Juneau REST APIs | Spring Boot Web Controllers | Winner |
|---------|------------------|----------------------------|--------|
| **REST API creation** | Annotation-based with automatic content negotiation | Requires @RestController, @RequestMapping, etc. | **Juneau** - Simpler REST API setup |
| **Self-documenting APIs** | Automatic Swagger generation | Requires SpringDoc or similar | **Juneau** - Built-in documentation |
| **Content negotiation** | Automatic support for all formats (JSON, XML, HTML, etc.) with single method | Must define separate methods for each content type | **Juneau** - Single method handles all formats |
| **Serialization** | Built-in multi-format support | Requires additional configuration | **Juneau** - Integrated serialization |
| **Testing** | MockRestClient for serverless testing | Requires @SpringBootTest with embedded containers | **Juneau** - Faster testing |
| **Dependencies** | Minimal additional dependencies | Uses Spring's dependency injection | **Juneau** - Lighter footprint |
| **Integration** | Works seamlessly with Spring Boot | Native Spring Boot feature | **Spring Boot** - Native integration |
| **Learning curve** | New annotations to learn | Standard Spring annotations | **Spring Boot** - Familiar to Spring developers |
| **Ecosystem** | Focused on REST and serialization | Full Spring ecosystem | **Spring Boot** - Larger ecosystem |

**Use Juneau REST APIs when:** You want automatic content negotiation, built-in documentation, or need multi-format serialization in your Spring Boot application.

**Use Spring Boot Web Controllers when:** You prefer standard Spring patterns, need complex request handling, or want to leverage existing Spring knowledge.

**Note:** Juneau works perfectly with Spring Boot! You can use Juneau REST APIs alongside Spring Boot's dependency injection, security, and other features.

## Juneau vs JAX-RS

| Feature | Juneau | JAX-RS | Winner |
|---------|--------|--------|--------|
| **API simplicity** | POJO-based with automatic serialization | Requires explicit serialization handling | **Juneau** - Simpler API |
| **Content negotiation** | Automatic based on Accept headers | Manual content negotiation | **Juneau** - Automatic negotiation |
| **Documentation** | Automatic Swagger generation | Requires additional tools | **Juneau** - Built-in documentation |
| **Testing** | MockRestClient for unit testing | Requires external testing frameworks | **Juneau** - Integrated testing |
| **Dependencies** | Minimal dependencies | Requires JAX-RS implementation | **Juneau** - Fewer dependencies |
| **Standards compliance** | Proprietary but simple | Industry standard | **JAX-RS** - Standard compliance |
| **Ecosystem** | Smaller ecosystem | Large ecosystem with many implementations | **JAX-RS** - Larger ecosystem |
| **Learning curve** | Steeper initial learning | Well-documented standard | **JAX-RS** - Easier to learn |

**Choose Juneau when:** You want simplicity, automatic features, and minimal configuration.

**Choose JAX-RS when:** You need standards compliance, extensive ecosystem, or enterprise integration.

## Performance Benchmarks

### Serialization Performance
Juneau has been shown to be approximately **20% faster** than Jackson in performance tests, while maintaining excellent memory efficiency.

### Memory Usage
Juneau is optimized for memory efficiency, making it ideal for:
- High-throughput applications
- Memory-constrained environments
- Microservices with limited resources

### Startup Time
Juneau's minimal dependencies and lightweight design result in faster application startup times compared to heavier frameworks.

## Migration Considerations

### From Jackson to Juneau
- **Easy migration** for basic serialization use cases
- **Annotation mapping** available (see [Jackson Comparison](/docs/topics/JacksonComparison))
- **Performance benefits** with minimal code changes

### From Spring Boot Controllers to Juneau REST APIs
- **Gradual migration** possible - use alongside existing controllers
- **Automatic content negotiation** reduces boilerplate code
- **Built-in documentation** eliminates need for additional tools

### From JAX-RS to Juneau
- **Simplified API** with fewer annotations required
- **Automatic serialization** reduces manual configuration
- **Integrated testing** improves development workflow
