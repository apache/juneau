One of the most useful features of Juneau is the ability to generate Swagger-based OPTIONS pages for self-documenting
designs (i.e.
REST interfaces that document themselves).

As described previously, the `PetStore` example provides an example of auto-generated Swagger JSON:

![Swagger JSON](/img/doc-files/jrs.Swagger.1.png)

Using <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/bean/swagger/ui/SwaggerUI.html" target="_blank">SwaggerUI</a>, we're able to render that JSON as a
Swagger user interface:

![Swagger UI](/img/doc-files/jrs.Swagger.2.png)
