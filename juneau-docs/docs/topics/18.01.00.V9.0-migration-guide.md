| Old | New |
|-----|-----|
| <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestOp.html" target="_blank">@RestMethod</a> annotation. | Has been replaced with <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestOp.html" target="_blank">RestOp</a>, <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestGet.html" target="_blank">RestGet</a>, <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestPut.html" target="_blank">RestPut</a>, <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestPost.html" target="_blank">RestPost</a>, <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestDelete.html" target="_blank">RestDelete</a>, <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestOptions.html" target="_blank">RestOptions</a> |
| <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteOp.html" target="_blank">@RemoteMethod</a> annotation. | Has been replaced with <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteOp.html" target="_blank">RemoteOp</a>, <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteGet.html" target="_blank">RemoteGet</a>, <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemotePut.html" target="_blank">RemotePut</a>, <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemotePost.html" target="_blank">RemotePost</a>, <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteDelete.html" target="_blank">RemoteDelete</a>. |
| `BasicRestServletJena`, `BasicRestServletJenaGroup` classes. | These have been removed in 9.0 due to the removal of the Jena packages (due to security issues).<br />Replace with <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestServlet.html" target="_blank">BasicRestServlet</a> and <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestServletGroup.html" target="_blank">BasicRestServletGroup</a>. |
| <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Content.html" target="_blank">@Body</a> annotation. | Has been renamed to <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Content.html" target="_blank">@Content</a> (to better match HTTP naming conventions such as Content-Type/Content-Encoding headers). |
| `@Query(_default)`, `@FormData(_default)`. | Has been renamed to [Query.def](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Query.html#def) / [FormData.def](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/FormData.html#def).<br />Note however that <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestOp.html" target="_blank">@RestOp</a>-annotated parameters now also support use of Optional parameters which simplifies the coding of default values. |
| `@Rest(reqHeaders)`. | Has been renamed to [Rest.defaultRequestHeaders](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html#defaultRequestHeaders) and added [Rest.defaultResponseHeaders](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html#defaultResponseHeaders). |
| `@Rest(staticFiles)`. | Changed from a string array to a `Class<? extends StaticFiles>`.<br />If you're extending from <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestServlet.html" target="_blank">BasicRestServlet</a>/<a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestObject.html" target="_blank">BasicRestObject</a>, the [getHtdoc()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestOperations.html#getHtdoc(String,Locale)) is already implemented for you to provide static files under the sub-URI /htdocs/*.<br />The default implementation for finding static files is <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/staticfile/BasicStaticFiles.html" target="_blank">BasicStaticFiles</a> which provides basic out-of-the-box functionality, so you can usually just remove the previous `@Rest(staticFiles)` value. |
