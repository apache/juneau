#### Starter Project Zip

The `my-springboot-microservice.zip` file is a predefined starter Eclipse project for developing REST microservices
using the [juneau-rest-server-springboot](/docs/topics/JuneauRestServerSpringbootBasics) package with Spring Boot.

It includes a combination of the Juneau Core, Server, and Client APIs and all libraries needed to execute in a Java 1.8+
environment.

One significant difference is that we are not using the Juneau <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice.html" target="_blank">Microservice</a> API for our application but instead using the existing Spring Boot API.
