The following method can be used to associates entry modifiers to a config:

<tree>
<node-0><java-class><a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/config/Config.Builder.html" target="_blank">Config.Builder</a></java-class></node-0>
<node-1><java-method>[mods(Mod...)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/config/Config/Builder.html#mods(Mod...))</java-method></node-1>
</tree>

Mods are used to modify values before being persisted.
This can be used to replace or encode sensitive information.
They are denoted by a single character that gets appended between angle brackets on the property name (e.g. key).

Multiple modifiers can be denoted by multiple characters (e.g. key) and are applied/removed in the order denoted.
The framework comes built-in with a simple <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/config/mod/XorEncodeMod.html" target="_blank">xor-encode</a> mod
tied to the '*' character.

The following shows how it is used:

```ini
[MyHost]
url = http://localhost:9080/foo
user = me
password = {AwwJVhwUQFZEMg==}
```

Custom encoders can be used to provide your own encoding support by implementing the <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/config/mod/Mod.html" target="_blank">Mod</a> class.

<tree>
<node-0><java-class><a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/config/mod/Mod.html" target="_blank">Mod</a></java-class></node-0>
<node-1><java-method>[apply(String)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/config/mod/Mod.html#apply(String))</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[remove(String)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/config/mod/Mod.html#remove(String))</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[isApplied(String)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/config/mod/Mod.html#isApplied(String))</java-method></node-1>
</tree>

Unmodified values are encoded when the file is saved using the [Config.commit()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/config/Config.html#commit()) method.
They can also be encoded immediately by calling [Config.applyMods()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/config/Config.html#applyMods()) which can typically be done during JVM startup to immediately encode any unencoded passwords in the file.
