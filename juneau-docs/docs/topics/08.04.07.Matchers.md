<a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/matcher/RestMatcher.html" target="_blank">RestMatchers</a> are used to allow multiple Java methods to
be tied to the same HTTP method and path but differentiated by some request attribute such as a specific header value.

:::tip Example
```java
// GET method that gets invoked for administrators
@RestGet(path="/*", matchers=IsAdminMatcher.class)
public Object doGetForAdmin() {
    ...
}

// GET method that gets invoked for everyone else
@RestGet("/*")
public Object doGetForEveryoneElse() {
    ...
}
```
:::

The interface for matchers is simple:

```java
public class IsAdminMatcher extends RestMatcher {

    @Override /* RestMatcher */
    public boolean matches(RestRequest req) {
        return req.isUserInRole("ADMINS_GROUP");
    }
}
```

:::note
- If no methods are found with a matching matcher, a 412 Precondition Failed status is returned.
- If multiple matchers are specified on the same method, ONLY ONE matcher needs to match for the method to be invoked.
- Note that you CANNOT define identical paths on different methods UNLESS you use matchers.
That includes paths that are only different in variable names (e.g. `/foo/{bar}` and `/foo/{baz}`).
If you try to do so, a ServletException will be thrown on startup.
- Methods with matchers take precedence over methods without.
Otherwise, methods are attempted in the order they appear in the class.
