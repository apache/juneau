Child Resources are REST servlets or objects that are linked to parent resources through the <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html#children()" target="_blank">@Rest(children)</a> annotation.

:::tip Example
```java
/** Parent Resource */
@Rest(
    path="/parent",
    children={MyChildResource.class}
)
public MyRootResources extends BasicRestServletGroup {...}
```

```java
/** Child Resource */
@Rest(
    path="/child"  // Path relative to parent resource.
)
// Note that we don't need to extend from RestServlet.
public MyChildResource extends BasicRestObject {...}
```
:::

The path of the child resource gets appended to the path of the parent resource.
So in the example above, the child resource is accessed through the URL `/parent/child`.

One advantage of using child resources is that they do not need to be declared in the JEE `web.xml` file.

Initialization of and access to the child resources occurs through the parent resource.

Children can be nested arbitrary deep to create complex REST interfaces with a single top-level REST servlet.

As explained earlier, child REST objects typically extend from <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestObject.html" target="_blank">BasicRestObject</a> or <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestObjectGroup.html" target="_blank">BasicRestObjectGroup</a> and not from one of the servlet classes.
They also technically don't even need to extend from those classes and can instead just be a normal class annotated with
the bare-minimum <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html" target="_blank">@Rest</a> and <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestOp.html" target="_blank">@RestOp</a> annotations.
