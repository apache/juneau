The Microservice API consists of a base class for defining executable microservices.

Features include:

- A builder-based API for defining and starting microservices.
- An extensible API that allows you to hook into various lifecycle events.
- Simple-to-use APIs for accessing manifest file entries, command-line arguments, and external configuration file properties.

The Microservice API consists of the following packages and classes:

<tree>
<node-0>Microservice API</node-0>

<node-2><java-class><a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/microservice/console/ConsoleCommand.html" target="_blank">ConsoleCommand</a></java-class> - Abstract class for defining console commands.</node-2>
</tree>

By itself the Microservice API doesn't provided much functionality but it does provide the basis for the Jetty
Microservice described later.
The most-basic creation of a microservice from an entry-point method is shown below:

```java
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Microservice
            .create()   // Create builder.
            .args(args) // Pass in args.
            .build()    // Create microservice.
            .start()    // Start microservice.
        ;
    }
}
```
