#### Contents/Features

The `juneau-config` library contains a powerful API for creating and using INI-style config files.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Support for storing and retrieving any of the following data types:
  - Primitives  
  - POJOs
  - Beans
  - Arrays, `Maps`, and `Collections` of anything
  - Binary data
- Transactional modifications with commit/rollback capabilities
- A listener API
- Filesystem watcher integration allowing changes on the file system to be reflected in real-time
- Modifications through the `Config` class (e.g. add/remove/modify sections and keys, add/remove comments and whitespace, etc...) **DO NOT** cause loss of formatting in the file - all existing whitespace and comments are preserved
- Value encoding for added security
- Support for SVL variables
- Directly populate beans from config sections
- Accessing config sections through Java interface proxies
- An extensible storage API allows you to write your own config storage (e.g. storage in databases or the cloud)
