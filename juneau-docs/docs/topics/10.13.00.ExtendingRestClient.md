The <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient.html" target="_blank">RestClient</a> API has been designed to allow for the ability to be easily extended.

The following example that overrides the primary run method shows how this can be done.

:::tip Example
```java
public class MyRestClient extends RestClient {

    // Must provide this constructor!
    public MyRestClient(ContextProperties ps) {
        super(ps);
    }

    @Override
    public HttpResponse run(HttpHost target, HttpRequest request, HttpContext context) throws IOException {
        // Perform special handling of requests.
    }
}

// Instantiate your client.
MyRestClient client = RestClient.create().json().build(MyRestClient.class);
```

The <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestRequest.html" target="_blank">RestRequest</a> and <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestResponse.html" target="_blank">RestResponse</a> objects can also be extended and integrated by overriding the
<a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient.html#createRequest(java.net.URI,java.lang.String,boolean)" target="_blank">createRequest(URI, String, boolean)</a> and <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient.html#createResponse(org.apache.juneau.rest.client.RestRequest,org.apache.http.HttpResponse,org.apache.juneau.parser.Parser)" target="_blank">createResponse(RestRequest, HttpResponse, Parser)</a> methods.
