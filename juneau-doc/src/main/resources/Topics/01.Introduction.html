Introduction

<p>
	Apache Juneau&trade; is a single cohesive Java ecosystem consisting of the following parts:
</p>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li><b>juneau-marshall</b> - A universal toolkit for marshalling POJOs to a wide variety of content types using a common framework with no external library dependencies.
	<li><b>juneau-dto</b> - A variety of predefined DTOs for serializing and parsing languages such as HTML5, Swagger and ATOM.
	<li><b>juneau-svl</b> - A simple yet powerful variable replacement language API.
	<li><b>juneau-config</b> - A sophisticated configuration file API.
	<li><b>juneau-rest-server</b> - A universal REST server API for creating Swagger-based self-documenting REST interfaces using POJOs, simply deployed as 
		one or more top-level servlets in any Servlet 3.1.0+ container.
	<li><b>juneau-rest-client</b> - A universal REST client API for interacting with Juneau or 3rd-party REST interfaces using POJOs and proxy interfaces.
	<li><b>juneau-microservice</b> - A REST microservice API that combines all the features above with a simple configurable Jetty server for 
		creating lightweight standalone REST interfaces that start up in milliseconds.
</ul>

	Juneau is packed with features that may not be obvious at first.  
	Users are encouraged to ask for code reviews by providing links to specific source files such as through GitHub.
	Not only can we help you with feedback, but it helps us understand usage patterns to further improve the product.

<h5 class='topic'>History</h5>
<p>
	Juneau started off as a popular internal IBM toolkit called Juno.
	Originally used for serializing POJOs to and from JSON, it later expanded in scope to include a variety of 
	content types, and then later REST servlet, client, and microservice APIs.
	It's use grew to more than 50 projects and was one of the most popular community source projects within IBM.
</p>
<p>
	In June of 2016, the code was donated to the Apache Foundation under the project <l>Apache Juneau</l> where it 
	has continued to evolve to where it is today.
