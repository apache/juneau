RestContext

<p>
	The {@link org.apache.juneau.rest.RestContext} object is the workhorse class for all of the configuration
	of a single REST resource class.
	<br>It's by-far the most important class in the REST API.
</p>
<p>
	Every class annotated with <l>@RestResource</l> ends up with an instance of this object.
	<br>The object itself is read-only and unchangeable.
	<br>It is populated through the following:
</p>
<ul>
	<li class='ja'>{@link org.apache.juneau.rest.annotation.RestResource} - Settings copied from the annotation during servlet initialization.
	<li class='jm'>{@link org.apache.juneau.rest.RestContextBuilder} - Builder used during servlet initialization.
</ul>
<p>
	The annotation should be self-explanatory at this point.
	<br>The builder allows you to perform all of the same configuration as the annotation programmatically.
</p>
<p>
	The {@link org.apache.juneau.rest.RestContextBuilder} class extends {@link org.apache.juneau.BeanContextBuilder}
	allowing you to programmatically set any properties defined on that builder class.
	<br>It also implements {@link javax.servlet.ServletConfig}
</p>
<p>
	To access this object, simply pass it in as a constructor argument or in an INIT hook:
</p>
<p class='bcode w800'>
	<jc>// Option #1 - Pass in through constructor.</jc>
	<jk>public</jk> MyResource(RestContextBuilder builder) {
			builder
				.pojoSwaps(CalendarSwap.<jsf>RFC2822DTZ</jsf>.<jk>class</jk>)
				.set(<jsf>PARSER_debug</jsf>, <jk>true</jk>);
	}

	<jc>// Option #2 - Use an INIT hook.</jc>
	<ja>@RestHook</ja>(<jsf>INIT</jsf>)
	<jk>public void</jk> init(RestContextBuilder builder) <jk>throws</jk> Exception {
			builder
				.pojoSwaps(CalendarSwap.<jsf>RFC2822DTZ</jsf>.<jk>class</jk>)
				.set(<jsf>PARSER_debug</jsf>, <jk>true</jk>);
	}
</p>
<p>
	Warning:  The builder class is huge.
	Through it, you can configure bean/serializer/parser settings, define config files, children, 
		resource finders, info providers, etc...
</p>
