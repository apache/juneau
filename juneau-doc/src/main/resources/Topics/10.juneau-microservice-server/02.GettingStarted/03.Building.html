Building and Running from Command-Line

<p>
	The <l>pom.xml</l> file is a basic Maven build script for creating your microservice
	as an executable uber-jar.
</p>
<p>
	The easiest way to build your microservice is to run the following from the project root.
</p>
<p class='bcode w800'>
	mvn clean install
</p>
<p>
	Your <code>target</code> directory should now contain the following files:
</p>
<ul>
	<li><code>my-microservice-1.0.jar</code>
	<li><code>my-microservice.cfg</code>
	<li><code>jetty.xml</code>
</ul>
<p>
	To start from a command line, run the following command from inside your <code>target</code> directory:
</p>
<p class='bcode w800'>
	java -jar my-microservice-1.0.jar
</p>
<p>
	You should see the following console output:
</p>
<p class='bcode w800'>
	Running class 'RestMicroservice' using config file 'my-microservice.cfg'.
	Server started on port 10000
	
	List of available commands:
		exit -- Shut down service
		restart -- Restarts service
		help -- Commands help
	
	> 			
</p>
<p>
	If you get this error message: <code class='snippet'>java.net.BindException: Address already in use</code>, 
	then this microservice is already running elsewhere and so it cannot bind to port 10000.
</p>
