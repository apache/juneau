{new} Custom Templates

<p>
	Custom page templates can be created by implementing the {@link org.apache.juneau.html.HtmlDocTemplate}
	interface and associating it with your {@link org.apache.juneau.html.HtmlDocSerializer} using the {@link org.apache.juneau.html.HtmlDocSerializer#HTMLDOC_template HTMLDOC_template}
	setting.
</p>
<ul class='doctree'>
	<li class='ja'>{@link org.apache.juneau.html.HtmlDocTemplate}
	<ul>
		<li class='jm'>{@link org.apache.juneau.html.HtmlDocTemplate#writeTo(HtmlDocSerializerSession,HtmlWriter,Object) writeTo(HtmlDocSerializerSession,HtmlWriter,Object)}
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
	The interface implementation is open-ended allowing you to define the contents of the page any way you wish.
</p>
