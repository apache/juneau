One-way PojoSwaps

<p>
	In the previous sections, we defined two-way swaps, meaning swaps where the original objects could be 
	reconstructing during parsing. 
	<br>However, there are certain kinds of POJOs that we may want to support for serializing, but that are not 
	possible to reconstruct during parsing.  
	<br>For these, we can use one-way object swaps.
</p>
<p>
	A one-way POJO swap is simply an object transform that only implements the {@code swap()} method.  
	<br>The {@code unswap()} method is simply left unimplemented.
</p>
<p>
	An example of a one-way swaps would be one that allows {@code Iterators} to be serialized as JSON arrays.  
	<br>It can make sense to be able to render {@code Iterators} as arrays, but in general it's not possible to 
	reconstruct an {@code Iterator} during parsing. 
</p>
<p class='bcode w800'>
	<jk>public class</jk> IteratorSwap <jk>extends</jk> PojoSwap&lt;Iterator,List&gt; {
		<ja>@Override</ja> <jc>/* PojoSwap */</jc>
		<jk>public</jk> List swap(Iterator o) {
			List l = <jk>new</jk> LinkedList();
			<jk>while</jk> (o.hasNext())
				l.add(o.next());
			<jk>return</jk> l;
		}
	}
</p>
<p>
	Here is an example of our one-way swap being used.  
	<br>Note that trying to parse the original object will cause a {@link org.apache.juneau.parser.ParseException} 
	to be thrown.
