{new} OpenAPI Details

<p>
	Juneau supports converting arbitrary POJOs to and from strings using OpenAPI-based schema rules. 
</p>
<p>
	The relevant classes for using OpenAPI-based serialization are:
</p>
<ul class='doctree'>
	<li class='jc'>{@link org.apache.juneau.httppart.OpenApiPartSerializer} - Converts POJOs to strings.
	<li class='jc'>{@link org.apache.juneau.httppart.OpenApiPartParser} - Converts strings to POJOs.
	<li class='jc'>{@link org.apache.juneau.httppart.HttpPartSchema} - Defines the schema for your POJO.
</ul>
<p>
	The {@link org.apache.juneau.httppart.HttpPartSchema} class is used to define the formatting and 
	validations for a POJO.
	It's used in conjunction with the serializer and parser to produce and consume HTTP parts based on 
	OpenAPI rules.
</p>
<p>
	Later in the rest-server and rest-client sections, we also describe how the following annotations
	can be applied to method parameters and class types to define the schema for various HTTP parts:
</p>
<ul class='doctree'>
	<li class='ja'>{@link org.apache.juneau.http.annotation.Body Body}
	<li class='ja'>{@link org.apache.juneau.http.annotation.Header Header}
	<li class='ja'>{@link org.apache.juneau.http.annotation.Query Query}
	<li class='ja'>{@link org.apache.juneau.http.annotation.FormData FormData}
	<li class='ja'>{@link org.apache.juneau.http.annotation.Path Path}
</ul>
