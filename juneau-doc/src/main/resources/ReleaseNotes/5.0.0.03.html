5.0.0.3 (Oct 3, 2012)

<p>
	Juno 5.0.0.3 is a minor update.
</p>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>
		Support for parsing into read-only beans (i.e. beans with only getters, property values set through constructor args).<br>
		To support this, the {@link org.apache.juneau.annotation.BeanConstructor @BeanConstructor} annotation has been added.
	</li>
	<li>
		Merged separate settings classes back into their base classes (simplifies the API).
	</li>
	<li>
		{@link org.apache.juneau.serializer.SerializerGroup SerializerGroups} and {@link org.apache.juneau.parser.ParserGroup ParserGroups} now share {@link org.apache.juneau.BeanContext BeanContexts} to reduce memory consumption of class type metadata.	
	</li>	
</ul>
