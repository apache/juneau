5.1.0.6 (Sept 21, 2014)

<p>
	Juno 5.1.0.6 is a moderate update.
</p>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>Simplified API for {@link org.apache.juneau.transform.PojoSwap}.  
		Since it's rarely used, the <code>beanContext</code> parameter was replaced with a <del><code>PojoSwap#getBeanContext()</code></del> method on
		the class.
	<li>New simplified way of defining POJO filters without needing to extend {@link org.apache.juneau.transform.PojoSwap}.
		See {@link org.apache.juneau.transform.SurrogateSwap} for details.
	<li>New {@link org.apache.juneau.html.annotation.Html @Html} annotation.
		Will allow the definition of standard XHTML DTOs in future releases.  
		For now, <del><code>Img</code></del> is an example of defining an XHTML element using Juno DTOs.
	<li>{@link org.apache.juneau.json.JsonParser} now ignores trailing <code>';'</code> characters in input so that it can 
		parse strings of the form <js>"var x = {'foo':'bar'};"</js>.
	<li>New <code>TumblrParserResource</code> in the samples war file showing how to combine the REST client and server APIs into a single
		resource in order to download Tumblr blogs and convert the response into any supported response content type.
</ul>
