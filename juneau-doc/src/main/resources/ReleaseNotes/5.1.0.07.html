5.1.0.7 (Oct 5, 2014)

<p>
	Juno 5.1.0.7 is a moderate update.
</p>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>Improved error handling.  
	<li>New <code><del>ParserContext.PARSER_debug</del></code> and <code><del>SerializerContext.SERIALIZER_debug</del></code>.
		settings for logging additional information for debugging problems.
	<li>New <code><del>SERIALIZER_ignoreRecursions</del></code> setting for explicitly ignoring recursions when 
		serializing models.  Previously, the <jsf>SERIALIZER_detectRecursions</jsf> setting did this, but now it simply looks for recursions 
		and throws exceptions when they occur.
	<li>Improved handling of <code>StackOverflowErrors</code>.  When <jsf>SERIALIZER_detectRecursions</jsf> is enabled, a useful error message
		is displayed showing the exact chain of objects that resulted in the stack overflow.
	<li>Bug fixes in {@link org.apache.juneau.dto.ResultSetList} for Oracle and SQL Server.
	<li>Serializers and parsers can now access HTTP request attributes, parameters, and headers through <code>SerializerContext.getProperties()</code> and
		<code>ParserContext.getProperties()</code>.		
	<li>Removed media-type and encoding attributes from <code><del>SerializerContext</del></code> and <code><del>ParserContext</del></code>	
		since these are now available through context properties, and are typically not used.
	<li>{@link org.apache.juneau.xml.XmlParser} now accepts <code>application/xml</code>.		
	<li>Improved handling of bean property serialization when multiple matching pojo filters for the bean property class exist.
	<li>Improved concurrency on BeanContext class.
	<li>Fixed bug in {@link org.apache.juneau.rest.converters.Traversable} that was causing it to be executed even if the servlet extra path info was empty.
	<li>Fixed bug in {@link org.apache.juneau.rest.converters.Traversable} where it was not picking up filters and properties defined on REST Java methods. 
</ul>
