<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Juno 5.0.0.36 is a minor update.
	</p>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>Implemented <c>org.apache.juneau.urlencoding.UrlEncodingParser.parseArgs(Reader,int,ClassMeta[])</c>.
		<li><c>name</c> parameter of <del>ResourceDescription.ResourceDescription(String,String,String)</del>. 
			is now automatically URL-encoded so that the name can contain special characters (e.g. <js>"foo/bar(baz)"</js>).
		<li>Support for URL-matching and path info containing encoded characters (e.g. <js>'/'</js>) now supported.	
		<li>Removed some lazy-initialization of bean information in {@link oaj.ClassMeta} that allowed the removal of
			some synchronized blocks.
		<li>Improved support of <del>BeanContext.getClassMetaFromString(String)</del>.
			Now supports primitive arrays such as <js>"long[]"</js> in addition to the previous support for the equivalent <js>"[J"</js>.
		<li>Various new convenience methods added to <del>StringUtils</del> and <del>ClassUtils</del>.
	</ul>
