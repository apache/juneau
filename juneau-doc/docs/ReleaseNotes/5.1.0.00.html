5.1.0.0 (Jan 18, 2014)

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Juno 5.1.0.0 is a major update.
	</p>
	<h5 class='topic w800'>Major changes</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>Brand new REST client API that uses Apache HttpClient for HTTP communication.<br>
			The new client API is simply a thin layer on top of <c>HttpClient</c> that performs 
			serialization and parsing using Juno parsers but leaves all the details of the HTTP connection
			to the Apache code. <br>
			See the <del>client</del> package for details.
		<li>New <c>org.apache.juneau.rest.client.jazz</c> package and <c>org.apache.juneau.rest.client.jazz.JazzRestClient</c> class
			for performing REST operations against Jazz servers.<br>
			Includes improved support for FORM authentication, and better SSL certificate validation.
		<li>Completely redesigned URL-Encoding support.<br>
			See <del>urlencoding</del> package for details. 
		<li>Changes to Parser API.
		<ul>
			<li>Removal of <c>ExtendedReaderParser</c> abstract class and moved methods into 
				{@link oaj.parser.ReaderParser} class.  
			<li>Removal of <c>DataFormat</c> class from API since it was no longer necessary
				due to API change above.
			<li>Removal of <c>ParserStringReader</c> class.<br>
				This was a reader optimized to work with <c>String</c> input.<br>
				However, it could interfere with garbage collection of the original string object.<br>
				Instead, the existing {@link oaj.parser.ParserReader} was enhanced to work
				well with <c>String</c> input, and tests show no significant performance differences.
			<li>New <c>org.apache.juneau.parser.Parser.parse(Object,int,ClassMeta)</c> convenience method added.
		</ul>
	</ul>	
	<h5 class='topic w800'>Other changes</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>Various new methods added to <del>StringUtils</del> and <del>ClassUtils</del>.
		<li>Improved support on <del>BeanContext.getClassMetaFromString(String)</del>.<br>
			Now supports resolving <c>"long[]"</c>, and so forth.
		<li><del>ResourceDescription</del>name parameter is now automatically URL-encoded in links.
		<li>{@link oajr.RestRequest} now correctly handles cases involving URL-encoded characters in the 
			path info portion of URLs (e.g. <c>http://host/contextRoot/foo%2Fbar</c>).
		<li>Removed lazy-initialization that required locking in {@link oaj.ClassMeta}.  
		<li>New <c>BeanContext.setDefaultParser(ReaderParser)</c> method added for specifying 
			a default parser to use in a bean context (used when converting beans to <c>Strings</c> using 
			<del>BeanContext.convertToType(Object,Class)</del>.
			Old behavior simply used the default JSON serializer in these cases.
		<li>More consistent handling of exceptions across all parsers.
		<li>Minor changes to {@link oajr.RestRequest} class.
		<ul>
			<li>Changed the order of parameters on <del>RestRequest.getParameter(String,Class)</del>.
			<li>Added <c>RestRequest.getMapParameter(String,Class,Class,Class)</c> and 
				<c>RestRequest.getCollectionParameter(String,Class,Class)}</c> methods.
		</ul>
	</ul>
