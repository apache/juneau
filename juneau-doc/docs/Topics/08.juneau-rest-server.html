	<p>
		The <l>juneau-rest-server</l> library allows you to quickly wrap POJOs and expose them as full-fledged REST 
		resources served up in a servlet container using a bare-minimum amount of code.
		The primary goal for Juneau was to make it as easy as possible to implement easy-to-read and self-documenting 
		REST resources using very little code.
	</p>
	<p>
		One of the biggest advantages of the Juneau REST framework over similar architectures is that it hides the 
		serialization layer from the developer.  
		The developer can work entirely with POJOs and let the Juneau framework handle all the serialization and 
		parsing work.  
		The developer need never know what the <l>Accept</l> or <l>Content-Type</l> or <l>Accept-Encoding</l> (etc...) 
		header values are because those details are all handled by the framework. 
	</p>
	<p> 
		The API builds upon the existing JEE Servlet API.  
		The root class, {@link oajr.servlet.RestServlet} is nothing but a specialized 
		{@link javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet}, and the {@link oajr.RestRequest} and 
		{@link oajr.RestResponse} classes are nothing more than specialized 
		{@link javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest} and {@link javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse} objects.  
		This allows maximum flexibility for the developer since you can let Juneau handle operations such as 
		serialization, or you can revert to the existing servlet APIs to do low-level processing of requests yourself.	
		It also means you need nothing more than a Servlet container such as Jetty to use the REST framework.

	<h5 class='topic'>Features</h5>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			Deployable in standard Servlet containers.
		<li>
			Deployable in Spring Boot environments with full support for injected beans.
		<li>
			Serializes POJOs to JSON, XML, HTML, URL-Encoding, UON, RDF/XML, N-Triple, Turtle, N3, SOAP, or 
			Java-serialized-object based on value of <l>Accept</l> header.  
			<br>No user code is required to handle these types.
			<ul>
				<li>Extensible design that provides ability to override existing content type handlers, or add the 
					ability to handle other kinds of content types.
			</ul>
		<li>
			Parses content of POST/PUT request bodies to POJOs.
		<li>
			Automatic built-in ability to serialize POJO metadata to JSON+SCHEMA, XML+SCHEMA, or HTML+SCHEMA based on 
			<l>Accept</l> header.
		<li>
			Automatic negotiation of output Writer based on HTTP headers.
			<ul>
				<li>Automatic handling of <l>Accept-Charset</l> header for all character sets supported by the JVM.
				<li>Automatic handling of <l>Accept-Encoding</l> header with registered encoders.
			</ul>
		<li>
			Automatic error handling.
			<ul>
				<li>Automatic 401 errors (Unauthorized) on failed guards.
				<li>Automatic 404 errors (Not Found) on unmatched path patterns.
				<li>Automatic 405 errors (Method Not Implemented) on unimplemented methods.
				<li>Automatic 406 errors (Not Acceptable) when no matching serializer was found to handle the 
					<l>Accept</l> header.
				<li>Automatic 412 errors (Precondition Failed) when all matchers failed to match.
				<li>Automatic 415 errors (Unsupported Media Type) when no matching parser was found was found to handle 
					the <l>Content-Type</l> header.
				<li>Automatic 500 errors on uncaught exceptions.
			</ul>
		<li>
			Support for parsing all HTTP parts (headers, query, formData, path variables) using Swagger formatting rules and validations.
			<br>Not limited to simple POJOs but rather you can represent arbitrarily-complex POJOs in any HTTP part using UON notation.
		<li>
			Auto-created Swagger JSON and Swagger UI available through OPTIONS requests of resources.
		<li>
			Various useful debugging features that make debugging using a browser extremely simple...
			<ul>
				<li>Ability to pass HTTP header values as URL GET parameters (e.g. <l>&amp;Accept=text/xml</l>).
				<li>Ability to pass HTTP content on PUT/POST requests as a URL GET parameter 
					(e.g. <l>&amp;content=(foo=bar)</l>).
				<li>Ability to simulate non-GET requests using a <l>&amp;method</l> GET parameter 
					(e.g. <l>&amp;method=POST</l>).
				<li>Ability to force <js>"text/plain"</js> on response using GET parameter <l>&amp;plainText=true</l>.
			</ul>
		<li>
			Ability to implement overloaded HTTP methods through the use of the <l>&amp;method</l> attribute 
			(e.g. <l>&amp;method=FOO</l>).
		<li>
			Ability to match URL patterns (e.g. <l>/foo/{fooId}/bar/{barId}</l>) against URLs 
			(e.g. <l>/foo/123/bar/456/bing</l>).
		<li>
			Ability to associate guards at the resource or method levels through annotations.
			<br>Typically useful for security but can be used for a variety of purposes.
		<li>
			Ability to associate converters at the resource or method levels through annotations.
			<br>Typically useful for performing conversions on input and output, such as for supporting older input and 
			output formats.
