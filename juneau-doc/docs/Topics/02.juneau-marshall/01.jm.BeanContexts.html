{title:'Bean Contexts', updated:'9.0.0'}

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		At the heart of the marshalling APIs is the {@link oaj.BeanContext Bean Context} API that provides a common
		framework for marshalling beans and POJOs across all serializers and parsers. 
		All serializers and parsers (and their builders) extend from the bean context API classes.
	</p>
	<p>
		One important feature of the bean context API is the ability to wrap Java beans inside maps to allow
		properties to be accessed through a Map layer.  Although this is used internally by all the serializers and parsers,
		it's often useful to use this feature by itself.
	</p>
	<h5 class='figure'>Example:</h5>
	<p class='bjava'>
		|	<jc>// Wrap a bean in a map and do some simple get/set calls.</jc>
		|	BeanMap&lt;MyBean&gt; <jv>myBeanMap</jv> = BeanContext.<jsf>DEFAULT_SESSION</jsf>.toBeanMap(<jv>myBean</jv>);
		|	<jv>myBeanMap</jv>.put(<js>"myProperty"</js>, 123);
		|	<jk>int</jk> <jv>myProperty</jv> = <jv>myBeanMap</jv>.get(<js>"myProperty"</js>, <jk>int</jk>.<jk>class</jk>);
	</p>
	<p>
		The bean context API provides many settings that fine-tune how POJOs should be handled during marshalling.
