{title:'Custom Templates'}

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Custom page templates can be created by implementing the {@link oaj.html.HtmlDocTemplate}
		interface and associating it with your {@link oaj.html.HtmlDocSerializer} using the {@link oaj.html.HtmlDocSerializer.Builder#template(Class)}
		setting.
	</p>
	<ul class='javatree'>
		<li class='jc'>{@link oaj.html.HtmlDocTemplate}
			<ul class='javatreec'>
				<li class='jm'>{@link oaj.html.HtmlDocTemplate#writeTo(HtmlDocSerializerSession,HtmlWriter,Object) writeTo(HtmlDocSerializerSession,HtmlWriter,Object)}
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		The interface implementation is open-ended allowing you to define the contents of the page any way you wish.
