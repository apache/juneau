{title:'VarResolvers and VarResolverSessions', updated:'9.0.0'}

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		The main class for performing variable resolution is {@link oaj.svl.VarResolver}.
		Two methods are provided for resolving variables:
	</p>
	<ul class='javatree'>
		<li class='jc'>{@link oaj.svl.VarResolver}
			<ul>
				<li class='jm'>{@link oaj.svl.VarResolver#resolve(String) resolve(String)} 
					- Resolves variables and returns the results as a simple string.
				<li class='jm'>{@link oaj.svl.VarResolver#resolveTo(String,Writer) resolveTo(String,Writer)} 
					- Resolves variables and sends results to a writer.
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Var resolvers can rely on the existence of other objects.
		For example, {@link oaj.config.vars.ConfigVar} relies on the existence of a {@link oaj.config.Config}.
		This is accomplished through the following method:
	</p>
	<ul class='javatree'>
		<li class='jc'>{@link oaj.svl.VarResolver.Builder} 
			<ul>
				<li class='jm'>{@link oaj.svl.VarResolver.Builder#bean(Class,Object) bean(Class&lt;T&gt;, T)} - Specify a bean for all sessions.
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li class='jc'>{@link oaj.svl.VarResolverSession}
			<ul>
				<li class='jm'>{@link oaj.svl.VarResolverSession#bean(Class,Object) bean(Class&lt;T&gt;, T)} - Specify a bean for this session.
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Beans are accessible through the following method:
	</p>
	<ul class='javatree'>
		<li class='jm'>{@link oaj.svl.VarResolverSession#getBean(Class)}
	</ul>
	<p>
		Var resolvers can be cloned and extended by using the {@link oaj.svl.VarResolver#copy()} method.
		Cloning a resolver will copy it's {@link oaj.svl.Var} class names and context objects.
	</p>
	
	<h5 class='figure'>Example:</h5>
	<p class='bjava'>
		|	<jc>// Create a resolver that copies the default resolver and adds $C and $A vars.</jc>
		|	VarResolver <jv>myVarResolver</jv> = VarResolver
		|		.<jsf>DEFAULT</jsf>
		|		.copy()
		|		.vars(ConfigVar.<jk>class</jk>, ArgsVar.<jk>class</jk>)
		|		.build();
