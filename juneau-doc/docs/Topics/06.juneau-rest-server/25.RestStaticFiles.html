{title:'Static files', flags:'todo'}

<p>
	The {@link oajr.annotation.Rest#staticFiles @Rest(staticFiles)} 
	annotation is used to define paths and locations of statically-served files such as images or HTML 
	documents.
</p>
<p>
	The value is a JSON map of paths to packages/directories located on either the classpath or working 
	directory.
</p>

<h5 class='figure'>Example:</h5>
<p class='bpcode w800'>
	<jk>package</jk> com.foo.mypackage;

	<ja>@Rest</ja>(
		path=<js>"/myresource"</js>,
		staticFiles={<js>"htdocs:docs"</js>}
	)
	<jk>public class</jk> MyResource <jk>extends</jk> BasicRestServlet {...}
</p>
<p>	
	Static files are found by calling {@link java.lang.Class#getResource(String)} up the class hierarchy.  
	If not found, then an attempt is made to find the class in the Java working directory.
</p>
<p>
	In the example above, given a GET request to <l>/myresource/htdocs/foobar.html</l>, the servlet will 
	attempt to find the <l>foobar.html</l> file in the following ordered locations:
</p>
<ol>
	<li><l>com.foo.mypackage.docs</l> package.
	<li><l>[working-dir]/docs</l> directory.
</ol>

<ul class='notes'>
	<li>
		Mappings are cumulative from parent to child.  
		<br>Child resources can override mappings made on parent resources.
	<li>
		The media type on the response is determined by the 
		{@del RestContext#getMediaTypeForName(String)} method.
</ul>

<ul class='seealso'>
	<li class='jf'>{@del oajr.RestContext#REST_staticFiles}
</ul>
