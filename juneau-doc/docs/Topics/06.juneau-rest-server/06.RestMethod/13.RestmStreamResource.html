{title:'StreamResource', flags:'todo'}

<p>
	The <dc>oaj.http.StreamResource</dc> class is the binary equivalent to the <dc>ReaderResource</dc> object.
	In essence, it's a container for binary data with optional response headers.
</p>
<p>
	The class is annotated with {@link oaj.http.annotation.Response @Response}
	which allows it to be returned as responses by REST methods.
</p>
