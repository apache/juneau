{title:'Microservice Overview', created:'8.0.0'}

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		The Microservice API consists of a base class for defining executable microservices.
	</p>
	<p>
		Features include:
	</p>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			A builder-based API for defining and starting microservices.
		<li>
			An extensible API that allows you to hook into various lifecycle events.
		<li>
			Simple-to-use APIs for accessing manifest file entries, command-line arguments, and external configuration 
			file properties.
	</ul>
	<p>
		The Microservice API consists of the following packages and classes:
	</p>
	<ul class='javatree'>
		<li class='jp'>{@link oaj.microservice}
			<ul>
				<li class='jc'>{@link oaj.microservice.Microservice} - The base microservice class.
				<li class='jc'>{@link oaj.microservice.Microservice.Builder} - Builder for the microservice class.
				<li class='jic'>{@link oaj.microservice.MicroserviceListener} - Interface for hooking into lifecyle events of the microservice.
					<ul>
						<li class='jc'>{@link oaj.microservice.BasicMicroserviceListener} - Adapter for MicroserviceListener class.
					</ul>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li class='jp'>{@link oaj.microservice.console}
			<ul>
				<li class='jac'>{@link oaj.microservice.console.ConsoleCommand} - Abstract class for defining console commands.
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		By itself the Microservice API doesn't provided much functionality but it does provide the basis for the <a class="doclink" href="#juneau-microservice-jetty">Jetty Microservice</a> described later.
	</p> 
	<p>
		The most-basic creation of a microservice from an entry-point method is shown below:
	</p>	
	<p class='bjava'>
		|	<jk>public class</jk> App {
		|		<jk>public static void</jk> main(String[] <jv>args</jv>) {
		|			Microservice
		|				.<jsm>create</jsm>()   <jc>// Create builder.</jc>
		|				.args(<jv>args</jv>) <jc>// Pass in args.</jc>
		|				.build()    <jc>// Create microservice.</jc>
		|				.start()    <jc>// Start microservice.</jc>
		|			;
		|		}
		|	}
	</p>
