Serializing

<p>
	The following methods are used for serializing <c>Config</c> objects back into INI files:
</p>
<ul class='doctree'>
	<li class='jc'>{@link oaj.config.Config}
	<ul>
		<li class='jm'>{@link oaj.config.Config#writeTo(Writer) writeTo(Writer)}
		<li class='jm'>{@link oaj.config.Config#toString() toString()}
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>
	Both methods are thread safe.
</p>
<p>
	The <c>Config</c> class implements the {@link oaj.Writable} which means it can be 
	returned as-is by REST methods to be serialized as INI text.
</p>
