{title:'Syntax Rules'}

<div class='topic'>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			Each config file contains zero or more sections containing zero or more entries:
			<p class='bini'>
				|	<cs>[Section1]</cs>
				|	<ck>key1</ck> = <cv>1</cv>
				|
				|	<cs>[Section2]</cs>
				|	<ck>key1</ck> = <cv>2</cv>
			</p>
		<li>
			Unicode escapes can be used in values.
			<p class='bini'>
				|	<ck>key1</ck> = <cv>\u0070\u0075\u0062\u006c\u0069\u0063</cv>
			</p>
		<li>
			Comment lines start with the <js>'#'</js> character and can be placed on lines before sections and entries:
			<p class='bini'>
				|	<cc># A comment about this section</cc>
				|	<cs>[Section1]</cs>
				|	
				|	<cc># A comment about this entry</cc>
				|	<ck>key1</ck> = <cv>1</cv>
			</p>
		<li>
			Comments can also be placed on the same line as entries:
			<p class='bini'>
				|	<ck>key1</ck> = <cv>1</cv>  <cc># A comment about this entry</cc>
			</p>
		<li>
			Values containing <js>'#'</js> must be escaped to prevent identification as a comment character:
			<p class='bini'>
				|	<ck>valueContainingPound</ck> = <cv>Value containing \u0023 character</cv>
			</p>
			<br>Likewise, <js>'\'</js> should be escaped to prevent confusion with unicode escapes.
		<li>
			Values containing newlines can span multiple lines.
			<br>Subsequent lines start with a tab character.
			<p class='bini'>
				|	<ck>multiLineValue</ck> = 
				|		<cv>line 1,</cv>
				|		<cv>line 2,</cv>
				|		<cv>line 3</cv>
			</p>
			<br>When retrieved, the above translates to <js>"line1,\nline2,\nline3"</js>.
		<li>
			Leading and trailing whitespace on values are ignored.
		<li>
			Whitespace is not ignored within multi-line values (except for the leading tab character on each line).
		<li>
			Blank lines can be used anywhere in the file.
			<p class='bini'>
				|	<cc># A comment line</cc>
				|	
				|	<cc># Another comment line</cc>
				|	<cs>[Section1]</cs>
				|	...
			</p>
		<li>
			Values located before any sections are considered part of the no-name section, meaning
			they are accessed simply by key and not section/key.
			<p class='bini'>
				|	<cc># Top of file</cc>
				|	
				|	<cc># Use config.getString("key1") to retrieve.</cc>
				|	<ck>key1</ck> = <cv>val1</cv>
				|	
				|	<cc># The first section</cc>
				|	<cs>[Section1]</cs>
				|
				|	<cc># Use config.getString("Section1/key2") to retrieve.</cc>
				|	<ck>key2</ck> = <cv>val2</cv>
			</p>
		<li>
			Section and key names must be at least one character long and not consist of any of the following
			characters:
			<p class='bini'>
				|	/ \ [ ] = #
			</p>
		<li>
			Whitespace in section and key names is technically allowed but discouraged.
	</ul>
