{title:'Deployment', updated:'9.0.0'}

	<p>
		REST resources are deployed in the following ways:
	</p>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>Deployed in a J2EE container as a servlet.</li>
		<li>Deployed in a Spring Boot environment as a servlet.</li>
		<li>Deployed as a child of another REST resource.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		When deployed in a J2EE container, you MUST extend from one of the servlet classes.
	</p>
	<ul class='notes'>
		<li class='note'>
			When deployed as a child of another resource, you MAY extend from one of the servlet classes but it's 
			not necessary.</b>
			The only requirement is that the class be annotated with <ja>@Rest</ja> and have one of the following constructors
			if they aren't already Spring Beans:
			<ul class='javatreec'>
				<li class='jm'><c><jk>public</jk> T()</c>
				<li class='jm'><c><jk>public</jk> T(RestContext.Builder)</c>
			</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		Deployment in a servlet container is typically done by adding a servlet entry for the top-level resources to the JEE <l>web.xml</l>.
	</p>
	<p>
		Deployment in a Spring Boot environment involves defining your top-level resources as Spring Beans.  
		Top-level resources must extend from {@link oajr.springboot.BasicSpringRestServlet} or {@link oajr.springboot.BasicSpringRestServletGroup}
		so that Juneau can hook into the injection framework provided by Spring.  Child resource CAN be defined as injected Spring Beans
		as well but it is not a requirement.
