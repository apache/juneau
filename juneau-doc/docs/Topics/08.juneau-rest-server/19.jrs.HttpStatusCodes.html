{title:'HTTP Status Codes', updated:'9.0.0'}

	<p>
		By default, a 200 (OK) status is automatically set as the HTTP status when a Java method executes 
		successfully.
	</p>
	<p>
		Other status codes can be generated by throwing a {@link oaj.http.response.BasicHttpException} with a 
		specific HTTP status code, or calling {@link javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse#setStatus(int)}.
	</p>
	<p>
		Non-OK (200) status codes are automatically triggered by the following conditions:
