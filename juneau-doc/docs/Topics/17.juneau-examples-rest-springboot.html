</p>	

<p>
	The <code>juneau-examples-rest-springboot</code> class contains the same examples as <code>juneau-examples-rest</code>
	but also includes the following:
</p>
<ul class='spaced-list'>
	<li>
		A starter class for invoking the examples using Spring Boot.
	<li>
		A resource resolver for resolving REST resources as injectable beans.
	<li>
		A POM that extends from <code>spring-boot-starter-parent</code> that allows you to build a fully-shaded executable jar.
	<li>
		Configuration files for deploying the microservice to Heroku.
</ul>

<p>
	The microservice app can be imported into Eclipse just like <code>juneau-examples-rest</code>.
</p>
<p>
	The microservice can be started from the <code>juneau-examples-rest-springboot.launch</code> file. 
	It will start up the microservice on port 5000 which you can then view through a browser.
</p>
<p>
	The Spring Boot examples app has identical functionality to the normal examples app except for console command support.
