title: "@ParentProperty Annotation"
slug: ParentPropertyAnnotation

The <a href="/site/apidocs/org/apache/juneau/annotation/ParentProperty.html" target="_blank">@ParentProperty</a> annotation is used to identify a setter method or field for adding a parent reference to a child object.

This annotation is used by parsers to automatically establish parent-child relationships when parsing nested objects. When a child object is created within a parent object (e.g., in a list or as a property), the parser automatically sets the parent reference on the child.

## Requirements

- Must be an **instance** method or field (not static)
- For methods: Must accept exactly one parameter (the parent object type)
- For fields: Can be any type (typically the parent object type)
- The method or field does not need to be public (will be made accessible automatically)

## Usage

Can be applied to:
- Bean setter methods or fields
- `@Rest`-annotated classes and `@RestOp`-annotated methods when using the `on()` parameter

## Example

### Using a Field

```java
public class AddressBook {
    public List<Person> people;
}

public class Person {
    @ParentProperty
    public AddressBook addressBook;  // Automatically set to containing AddressBook

    public String name;
    public char sex;
}
```

### Using a Setter Method

```java
public class AddressBook {
    public List<Person> people;
}

public class Person {
    private AddressBook parent;

    @ParentProperty
    protected void setParent(AddressBook parent) {
        this.parent = parent;
    }

    public String name;
    public char sex;
}
```

## When It's Called

- During parsing when a child object is created within a parent object
- The parser automatically calls the setter or sets the field with a reference to the parent object
- This allows child objects to navigate back to their parent if needed
- Useful for bidirectional relationships where child objects need access to their parent context
