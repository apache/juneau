`start-docusaurus.py` starts the Docusaurus development server with automatic cleanup and process management.

## What It Does

The script performs these operations before starting the server:

1. **Kills Existing Processes** - Automatically terminates any process running on port 3000
2. **Clears Caches** - Removes `.docusaurus`, `build`, and `node_modules/.cache` directories
3. **Starts Fresh Server** - Launches the Docusaurus development server
4. **Cross-Platform** - Works on macOS, Linux, and Windows

## Usage

### Start the Server

```bash
cd /Users/james.bognar/git/juneau
python3 scripts/start-docusaurus.py
```

The server will start at `http://localhost:3000/`

Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the server.

## When to Use

Use this script when:
- Starting development on documentation
- The server is acting strangely (cache issues)
- Need a clean server start
- Testing documentation changes locally

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Dependencies installed (`npm install` in `juneau-docs` directory)
- No external Python dependencies (uses only standard library)

## Notes

- The script automatically detects the `/juneau-docs` directory
- Cache clearing is automatic - no flags needed
- The server supports hot-reloading (changes appear immediately in browser)
- Port 3000 must be available (script will kill existing processes)
