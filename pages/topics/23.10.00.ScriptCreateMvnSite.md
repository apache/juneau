`create-mvn-site.py` generates the Maven site with Javadocs and copies it to the Docusaurus static directory for local testing and broken link validation.

## What It Does

The script performs these operations:

1. **Detects Version** - Automatically gets the project version from POM
2. **Cleans Old Site** - Removes existing `target/site` directory
3. **Generates Site** - Runs `mvn clean compile site` to create the Maven site
4. **Copies to Docusaurus** - Moves site to `/juneau-docs/static/site/`
5. **Logs Output** - Creates `create-mvn-site.log` in project root

## Usage

### Generate Maven Site

```bash
cd /Users/james.bognar/git/juneau
python3 scripts/create-mvn-site.py
```

The generated site will be available at `http://localhost:3000/site/` (after starting Docusaurus).

## When to Use

Use this script when:
- Testing broken link validation in Docusaurus
- Verifying that Maven site links work correctly
- Need to view the Maven site locally through Docusaurus
- Debugging documentation issues

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Maven (mvn command must be in PATH)
- Java 17+
- No external Python dependencies (uses only standard library)

## Notes

- The script creates a log file (`create-mvn-site.log`) in the project root
- The Maven site is copied to `juneau-docs/static/site/` where Docusaurus can serve it
- This is primarily for local testing - production builds use `build-docs.py`
