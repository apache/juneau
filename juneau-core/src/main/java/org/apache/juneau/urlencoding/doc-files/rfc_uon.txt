Abstract

   This document describes a grammar that builds upon RFC2396
   (Uniform Resource Identifiers).  Its purpose is to define a 
   generalized object notation for URI query parameter values similar in 
   concept to Javascript Object Notation (RFC4627).  The goal is a 
   syntax that allows for array and map structures to be
   such that any data structure defined in JSON can be losslessly 
   defined in an equivalent URI-based grammar, yet be fully compliant 
   with the RFC2396 specification. 

   This grammar provides the ability to construct the following data 
   structures in URL parameter values: 
	
      OBJECT
      ARRAY
      NUMBER
      BOOLEAN
      STRING
      NULL

   Example:

      The following shows a sample object defined in Javascript:

         var x = { 
            id: 1, 
            name: 'John Smith', 
            uri: 'http://sample/addressBook/person/1', 
            addressBookUri: 'http://sample/addressBook', 
            birthDate: '1946-08-12T00:00:00Z', 
            otherIds: null,
            addresses: [ 
               { 
                  uri: 'http://sample/addressBook/address/1', 
                  personUri: 'http://sample/addressBook/person/1', 
                  id: 1, 
                  street: '100 Main Street', 
                  city: 'Anywhereville', 
                  state: 'NY', 
                  zip: 12345, 
                  isCurrent: true,
               } 
            ] 
         } 

      Using the syntax defined in this document, the equivalent 
      UON notation would be as follows:

         x=(id=1,name=John+Smith,uri=http://sample/
         addressBook/person/1,addressBookUri=http://sample/
         addressBook,birthDate=1946-08-12T00:00:00Z,otherIds=%00,
         addresses=@((uri=http://sample/addressBook/
         address/1,personUri=http://sample/addressBook/
         person/1,id=1,street=100+Main+Street,city=
         Anywhereville,state=NY,zip=12345,isCurrent=true))) 

1. Language constraints

   The grammar syntax is constrained to usage of characters allowed by 
      URI notation:

      uric       = reserved | unreserved | escaped
      reserved   = ";" | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" | "&" | "=" | "+" |
                   "$" | ","
      unreserved = alphanum | mark
      mark       = "-" | "_" | "." | "!" | "~" | "*" | "'" | "(" | ")"

   In particular, the URI specification disallows the following 
   characters in unencoded form:

      unwise     = "{" | "}" | "|" | "\" | "^" | "[" | "]" | "`"
      delims     = "<" | ">" | "#" | "%" | <">

   The exclusion of {} and [] characters eliminates the possibility of 
   using JSON as parameter values.


2. Grammar constructs

   The grammar consists of the following language constructs:
   
      Objects - Values consisting of one or more child name/value pairs.
      Arrays - Values consisting of zero or more child values.
      Booleans - Values consisting of true/false values.
      Numbers - Decimal and floating point values.
      Strings - Everything else.

2.1. Objects 

   Objects are values consisting of one or more child name/value pairs.
   The (...) construct is used to define an object.

   Example:  A simple map with two key/value pairs:

      a1=(b1=x1,b2=x2)

   Example:  A nested map:
   
      a1=(b1=(c1=x1,c2=x2))

2.2. Arrays

   Arrays are values consisting of zero or more child values.
   The @(...) construct is used to define an array.

   Example:  An array of two string values:

      a1=@(x1,x2)

   Example:  A 2-dimensional array:

      a1=@(@(x1,x2),@(x3,x4))

   Example:  An array of objects:

      a1=@((b1=x1,b2=x2),(c1=x1,c2=x2))

2.3. Booleans

   Booleans are values that can only take on values "true" or "false".  
   
   Example:  Two boolean values:

      a1=true&a2=false
   
2.4. Numbers

   Numbers are represented without constructs.
   Both decimal and float numbers are supported.
   
   Example:  Two numerical values, one decimal and one float:

      a1=123&a2=1.23e1

2.5. Strings

   Strings are encapsulated in single quote (') characters.
   
   Example:  Simple string values:

      a1='foobar'&a2='123'&a3='true'
         
   The quotes are optional when the string cannot be confused
   with one of the constructs listed above (i.e. objects/arrays/
   booleans/numbers/null). 
   
   Example:  A simple string value, unquoted:

      a1=foobar
    
   Strings must be quoted for the following cases:
      
      - The string can be confused with a boolean or number.
      - The string is empty.
      - The string contains one or more whitespace characters.
      - The string starts with one of the following characters:
        @ (
      - The string contains any of the following characters:
        ) , =
   
   For example, the string literal "(b1=x)" should be 
   represented as follows:

      a1='(b1=x)'
   
   The tilde character (~) is used for escaping characters to prevent 
   them from being confused with syntax characters.  

   The following characters must be escaped in string literals:  

      ' ~
   
   Example:  The string "foo'bar~baz"

      a1='foo~'bar~~baz'
   
2.7. Null values

   Nulls are represented by the keyword 'null':

      a1=null

2.8. Top-level attribute names

   Top-level attribute names (e.g. "a1" in "&a1=foobar") are treated
   as strings but for one exception.  The '=' character must be
   encoded so as not to be confused as a key/value separator.
   Note that the '=' character must also be escaped per the UON
   notation.
   
   For example, the UON equivalent of {"a=b":"a=b"} constructed as
   a top-level query parameter string would be as follows:
   
      a~%3Db=a~=b
      
   Note that the '=' character is encoded in the attribute name,
   but it is not necessary to have it encoded in the attribute value.

2.9. URL-encoded characters

   UON notation allows for any character, even UON grammar
   characters, to be URL-encoded.
   
   The following query strings are fully equivalent in structure:
   
     a1=(b1='x1',b2='x2')
     %61%31=%24%6F%28%62%31%3D%78%31%2C%62%32%3D%78%32%29


3. BNF

   The following BNF describes the syntax for top-level URI query 
   parameter values (e.g. ?<attrname>=<value>).

   attrname    = (string | null)
   value       = (var | string | null)

   string      = ("'" litchar* "'") | litchar*
   null        = "%00"
   
   var         = ovar | avar | nvar | boolean | number
   ovar        = "(" [pairs] ")"
   avar        = "@(" [values] ")"

   pairs       = pair ["," pairs]
   pair        = key "=" value	
   values      = value ["," values]
   key         = (string | null)
   boolean     = "true" | "false"

   escape_seq  = "~" escaped
   encode_seq  = "%" digithex digithex

   number      = [-] (decimal | float) [exp]
   decimal     = "0" | (digit19 digit*)
   float       = decimal "." digit+
   exp         = "e" [("+" | "-")] digit+

   litchar     = unencoded | encode_seq | escape_seq
   escaped     = "@" | "," | "(" | ")" | "~" | "=" 
   unencoded   = alpha | digit | 
                 ";" | "/" | "?" | ":" | "@" |
                 "-" | "_" | "." | "!" | "*" | "'" 
   alpha       = "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "g" | "h" | "i" |
                 "j" | "k" | "l" | "m" | "n" | "o" | "p" | "q" | "r" |
                 "s" | "t" | "u" | "v" | "w" | "x" | "y" | "z" |
                 "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" | "G" | "H" | "I" |             
                 "J" | "K" | "L" | "M" | "N" | "O" | "P" | "Q" | "R" |
                 "S" | "T" | "U" | "V" | "W" | "X" | "Y" | "Z"
   digit       = "0" | digit19
   digit19     = "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" |
                 "8" | "9"
   digithex    = digit | 
                 "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | "E" | "F" |
                 "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f"
