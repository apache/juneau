If you do not already have one, you will need to send an individual Contributor License Agreement to the ASF.

Ask us (the PMC) if you have any questions.\n\nhttp://www.apache.org/licenses/#clas\n\nYou need to choose a preferred ASF user name and alternatives. In order to ensure it is available you can view a list of taken ids at\n\nhttp://people.apache.org/committer-index.html\n\nPlease notify us when you have submitted the iCLA and by what means you did so. This will enable us to monitor its progress.\n\nWe will arrange for your Apache user account when the iCLA has been recorded.\n\nAfter that is done, please make followup replies to the dev@juneau.apache.org list.
