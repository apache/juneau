# GitHub Pages Configuration for Juneau

## Overview

This repository is configured to automatically deploy documentation to GitHub Pages from a combination of:
- Static documentation files in `/docs`
- Generated Javadocs from `mvn javadoc:aggregate`

## How it works

### Automatic Deployment
The `pages.yml` workflow automatically deploys to GitHub Pages when:
- Code is pushed to the `master` or `main` branch
- Changes are made to `docs/**`, `juneau-*/**`, `pom.xml`, or the workflow file
- The workflow is manually triggered from the Actions tab

### Build Process
1. **Environment Setup**: Sets up Java 17 and Maven with dependency caching
2. **Build**: Compiles Juneau modules with `mvn clean compile -DskipTests`
3. **Site Generation**:
   - Builds the `juneau-doc` module (for custom documentation)
   - Generates complete project site with `mvn site -DskipTests`
   - Includes: Javadocs, test reports, dependency info, project reports
4. **Deployment**: Uploads entire `target/site` folder to GitHub Pages

### Documentation Structure
Once deployed, the comprehensive site will be available at:
- **Project Home**: `https://<username>.github.io/juneau/`
- **API Documentation**: `https://<username>.github.io/juneau/apidocs/` (if generated)
- **Test Reports**: `https://<username>.github.io/juneau/surefire.html`
- **Dependencies**: `https://<username>.github.io/juneau/dependencies.html`
- **Project Reports**: `https://<username>.github.io/juneau/project-reports.html`

## Manual Setup Required

### GitHub Pages Setup
After pushing this workflow, enable GitHub Pages in your repository:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions**
3. The site will be available at: `https://<username>.github.io/juneau/`

### Monitoring Deployments
To monitor deployment status and receive notifications:

1. **GitHub Pages Badge** - The README includes a status badge showing deployment status
2. **GitHub Notifications** - Enable repository notifications:
   - Go to the repository → **Watch** → **Custom** → **Actions**
   - Enable notifications for workflow runs in your GitHub profile settings
3. **Actions Tab** - Monitor deployments directly in the repository's Actions tab
4. **Commit Status** - Deployment status appears on commits and pull requests

### Deployment Status
- ✅ **Success**: Site is deployed and accessible at the GitHub Pages URL
- ❌ **Failure**: Check the Actions tab for detailed error logs
- 🟡 **In Progress**: Deployment is currently running

## Local Development

To generate the complete project site locally:

```bash
# Build the project
mvn clean compile -DskipTests

# Build documentation module
cd juneau-doc
mvn install -DskipTests
cd ..

# Generate complete project site
mvn site -DskipTests
```

The generated site will be available in:
- Complete site: `target/site/index.html`
- Project reports: `target/site/project-reports.html`
- Dependencies: `target/site/dependencies.html`
- Test results: `target/site/surefire.html`
- Javadocs: `target/site/apidocs/` (if aggregate goal works)

## Integration with Existing Build Scripts

This GitHub Pages workflow is designed to work alongside the existing `juneau-build-javadoc.sh` script:
- The GitHub workflow focuses on public documentation deployment
- The existing script handles more complex documentation generation and website publishing
- Both can coexist without conflicts
