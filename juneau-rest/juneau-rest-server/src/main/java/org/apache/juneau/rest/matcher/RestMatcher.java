/**
 * Class used for defining method-level matchers using the {@link RestOp#matchers() @RestOp(matchers)} annotation.
 *
 * <p>
 * Matchers are used to allow multiple Java methods to handle requests assigned to the same URL path pattern, but
 * differing based on some request attribute, such as a specific header value.
 * For example, matchers can be used to provide two different methods for handling requests from two different client
 * versions.
 *
 * <p>
 * Java methods with matchers associated with them are always attempted before Java methods without matchers.
 * This allows a 'default' method to be defined to handle requests where no matchers match.
 *
 * <p>
 * When multiple matchers are specified on a method, only one matcher is required to match.
 * This is opposite from the {@link RestOp#guards() @RestOp(guards)} annotation, where all guards are required to match in order to
 * execute the method.
 *
 * <h5 class='section'>Example:</h5>
 * <p class='bjava'>
 * 	<jk>public class</jk> MyResource <jk>extends</jk> BasicRestServlet {
 *
 * 		<ja>@RestGet</ja>(path=<js>"/foo"</js>, matchers=IsDNT.<jk>class</jk>)
 * 		<jk>public</jk> Object doGetWithDNT() {
 * 			<jc>// Handle request with Do-Not-Track specified</jc>
 * 		}
 *
 * 		<ja>@RestGet</ja>(<js>"/foo"</js>)
 * 		<jk>public</jk> Object doGetWithoutDNT() {
 * 			<jc>// Handle request without Do-Not-Track specified</jc>
 * 		}
 * 	}
 *
 * 	<jk>public class</jk> IsDNT <jk>extends</jk> RestMatcher {
 * 		<ja>@Override</ja>
 * 		<jk>public boolean</jk> matches(HttpServletRequest <jv>req</jv>) {
 * 			<jk>return</jk> <js>"1"</js>.equals(<jv>req</jv>.getHeader(<js>"DNT"</js>));
 * 		}
 * 	}
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Instances must provide one of the following public constructors:
 * <ul>
 * 	<li>No-args.
 * 	<li>The following args: <c>Object resource, Method javaMethod</c>.
 * 		<br>This gives access to the servlet/resource and Java method it's applied to.
 * </ul>
