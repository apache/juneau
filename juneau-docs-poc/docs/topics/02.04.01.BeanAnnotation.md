title: "@Bean Annotation"
---

The [@Bean](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html) annotation is used to tailor how beans are
interpreted by the framework.

Bean property inclusion and ordering on a bean class can be done using the
[@Bean(properties|p)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html#properties()) annotation.

```java
// Address class with only street/city/state properties (in that order).
// All other properties are ignored.
@Bean(properties="street,city,state")
public class Address { ... }
```

Bean properties can be excluded using the [@Bean(excludeProperties|xp)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html#excludeProperties())
annotation.

```java
// Address class with only street/city/state properties (in that order).
// All other properties are ignored.
@Bean(excludeProperties="city,state"})
public class Address { ... }
```

Bean properties can be sorted alphabetically using [@Bean(sort)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html#sort())

```java
// Address class with only street/city/state properties (in that order).
// All other properties are ignored.
@Bean(sort=true)
public class MyBean { ... }
```

The [@Bean(propertyNamer)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html#propertyNamer()) annotation
is used to provide customized naming of properties.

Property namers are used to transform bean property names from standard form to some other form.
For example, the [PropertyNamerDLC](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/PropertyNamerDLC.html) will convert property names to
dashed-lowercase, and these will be used as attribute names in JSON and element names in XML.

```java
// Define a class with dashed-lowercase property names.
@Bean(propertyNamer=PropertyNamerDashedLC.class)
public class MyBean { ... }
```

The [@Bean(interfaceClass)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html#interfaceClass) annotation is used
to limit properties on beans to specific interface classes.
When specified, only the list of properties defined on the interface class will be used during
serialization.
Additional properties on subclasses will be ignored.

```java
// Parent class
@Bean(interfaceClass=A.class)
public abstract class A {
    public String f0 = "f0";
}

// Child class
public class A1 extends A {
    public String f1 = "f1";
}

A1 a1 = new A1();
String result = Json5.of(a1);
assertEquals("{f0:'f0'}", result);  // Note f1 is not serialized.
```

Note that this annotation can be used on the parent class so that it filters to all child classes.
Or can be set individually on the child classes.

The [@Bean(stopClass)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html#stopClass) annotation is another
way to limit which properties are serialized (except from the opposite direction).
It's identical in purpose to the stop class specified by [Introspector.getBeanInfo(Class,Class)](TODO.md).
Any properties in the stop class or in its base classes will be ignored during analysis.

For example, in the following class hierarchy, instances of `C3` will include property
`p3` but not `p1` or `p2`.

```java
public class C1 {
    public int getP1();
}

public class C2 extends C1 {
    public int getP2();
}

@Bean(stopClass=C2.class)
public class C3 extends C2 {
    public int getP3();
}
```

The [@Bean(interceptor)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html#interceptor()) annotation
and [BeanInterceptor](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/swap/BeanInterceptor.html) class can be used to perform interception
and inline handling of bean getter and setter calls.

```java
// Interceptor that strips out sensitive information on Address beans.
public class AddressInterceptor extends BeanInterceptor {

    @Override
    public Object readProperty(Address bean, String name, Object value) {
        if ("taxInfo".equals(name))
            return "redacted";
        return value;
    }

    @Override
    public Object writeProperty(Address bean, String name, Object value) {
        if ("taxInfo".equals(name) && "redacted".equals(value))
            return TaxInfoUtils.lookup(bean.getStreet(), bean.getCity(), bean.getState());
        return value;
    }
}

// Register interceptor on bean class.
@Bean(interceptor=AddressInterceptor.class)
public class Address {
    public String getTaxInfo() {...}
    public void setTaxInfo(String value) {...}
}
```

The [@Bean(on)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html#on()) and [@Bean(onClass)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html#onClass())
annotations can be used to programmatically attach @Bean annotations to classes.

```java
@Bean(onClass=Address.class, sort=true, excludeProperties="city,state")
public class MyAnnotatedClass {...}

// Create a serializer configured using annotations.
JsonSerializer serializer = JsonSerializer
    .create()
    .applyAnnotations(MyAnnotatedClass.class)
    .build();
```
