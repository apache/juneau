title: "Config Files"
---

The juneau-config library contains a powerful API for creating and using INI-style config files.
### Example configuration file:


```ini
# A set of entries

[Section1]

# An integer

key1 = 1

# A boolean

key2 = true

# An array

key3 = 1,2,3

# A POJO

key4 = http://bar
```


Config files are accessed through the [Config](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/config/Config.html) class which
are created through the [Builder](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/config/Config/Builder.html) class.
Builder creator methods are provided on the `Config` class:

```java
// Create a Config object
Config config = Config.create().name("MyConfig.cfg").build();

// Read values from section #1
int key1 = config.getInt("Section1/key1");
boolean key2 = config.getBoolean("Section1/key2");
int[] key3 = config.getObject("Section1/key3", int[].class);
URL key4 = config.getObject("Section1/key4", URL.class);
```


The config language may look simple but it is a very powerful feature with many capabilities.
