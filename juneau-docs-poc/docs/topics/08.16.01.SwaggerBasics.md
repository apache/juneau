One of the most useful features of Juneau is the ability to generate Swagger-based OPTIONS pages for self-documenting
designs (i.e.
REST interfaces that document themselves).

As described previously, the `PetStore` example provides an example of auto-generated Swagger JSON:

![Swagger JSON](/img/doc-files/jrs.Swagger.1.png)

Using [SwaggerUI]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/dto/swagger/ui/SwaggerUI.html), we're able to render that JSON as a
Swagger user interface:
