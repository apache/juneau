title: "Syntax Rules"
---

-
Each config file contains zero or more sections containing zero or more entries:

```ini
[Section1]
key1 = 1

[Section2]
key1 = 2
```


-
Unicode escapes can be used in values.

```ini
key1 = \u0070\u0075\u0062\u006c\u0069\u0063
```


-
Comment lines start with the '#' character and can be placed on lines before sections and entries:

```ini
# A comment about this section

[Section1]

# A comment about this entry

key1 = 1
```


-
Comments can also be placed on the same line as entries:

```ini
key1 = 1  # A comment about this entry
```


-
Values containing '#' must be escaped to prevent identification as a comment character:

```ini
valueContainingPound = Value containing \u0023 character
```


Likewise, '\' should be escaped to prevent confusion with unicode escapes.
-
Values containing newlines can span multiple lines.
Subsequent lines start with a tab character.

```ini
multiLineValue =
    line 1,
    line 2,
    line 3
```


When retrieved, the above translates to "line1,\nline2,\nline3".
-
Leading and trailing whitespace on values are ignored.
-
Whitespace is not ignored within multi-line values (except for the leading tab character on each line).
-
Blank lines can be used anywhere in the file.

```ini
# A comment line

# Another comment line

[Section1]
...
```


-
Values located before any sections are considered part of the no-name section, meaning
they are accessed simply by key and not section/key.

```ini
# Top of file

# Use config.getString("key1") to retrieve.

key1 = val1

# The first section

[Section1]

# Use config.getString("Section1/key2") to retrieve.

key2 = val2
```


-
Section and key names must be at least one character long and not consist of any of the following
characters:

```ini
/ \ [ ] = #
```


-
Whitespace in section and key names is technically allowed but discouraged.
