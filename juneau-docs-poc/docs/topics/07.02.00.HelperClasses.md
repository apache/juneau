The [header](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/header.html) package contains various convenience classes for creating standard HTTP components using static imports.
- [HttpHeaders](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpHeaders.html) - Utility class for standard HTTP headers.
- [HttpParts](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpParts.html) - Utility class for standard HTTP parts.
- [HttpEntities](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpEntities.html) - Utility class for standard HTTP entities.
- [HttpResources](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpResources.html) - Utility class for standard HTTP resources.
- [HttpResponses](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpResponses.html) - Utility class for standard HTTP resources.

### HttpHeaders

The [HttpHeaders](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpHeaders.html) class contains many convenience static methods and fields for working with standard HTTP request and response headers and header lists.
:::tip Example


```java
import static org.apache.juneau.http.HttpHeaders.*;

HeaderList headers =
    headerList(  // Arbitrary list of headers

        CONTENTTYPE_TEXT_XML,   // Static constants

        contentType("text/xml")   // Predefined headers

        contentType(() -> "text/xml")   // Predefined headers with supplied values

        stringHeader("Content-Type", "text/xml")   // Freeform headers

        stringHeader("Content-Type", () -> "text/xml")   // Freeform headers with supplied values
    );
```


This class is vast in scope and covers all request and response headers defined in RFC2616.
In addition to the predefined headers, various methods are provided for free-form headers.  Each accepts
either static values or values from [Suppliers](../apidocs/java/util/function/Supplier.html):
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpHeaders#basicHeader(String,Object) basicHeader\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpHeaders#booleanHeader(String,String) booleanHeader\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpHeaders#csvHeader(String,String) csvHeader\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpHeaders#dateHeader(String,String) dateHeader\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpHeaders#entityTagsHeader(String,String) entityTagsHeader\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpHeaders#entityTagHeader(String,String) entityTagHeader\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpHeaders#integerHeader(String,String) integerHeader\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpHeaders#longHeader(String,String) longHeader\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpHeaders#mediaRangesHeader(String,String) mediaRangesHeader\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpHeaders#mediaTypeHeader(String,String) mediaTypeHeader\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpHeaders#stringHeader(String,String) stringHeader\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpHeaders#serializedHeader(String,Object) serializedHeader\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpHeaders#stringRangesHeader(String,String) stringRangesHeader\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpHeaders#uriHeader(String,String) uriHeader\}

The \{@link oaj.http.HttpHeaders#serializedHeader(String,Object) serializedHeader\} methods allows for headers
serialized using schema-based serializers such as the OpenAPI serializer.
Static methods are also provided for instantiating [Header](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Header.html)-annotated or
other HttpComponent-defined header classes:
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpHeaders#header(Class,String,Object) header(Class,String,Object)\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpHeaders#header(Class,Object) header(Class,String,Object)\}

:::

:::tip Example


```java
import static org.apache.juneau.http.HttpHeaders.*;

ContentType contentType = header(ContentType.class, "text/xml");
```


Lists of headers can be produced with the following methods:
- [headerList()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpHeaders.html#headerList())
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpHeaders#headerList(Header...) headerList(Header...)\}
- [headerList(List)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpHeaders.html#headerList(List))
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpHeaders#headerList(String...) headerList(String...)\}

The capabilities of the [HeaderList](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html) class is described later.
:::

### HttpParts

The [HttpParts](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpParts.html) class contains convenience static methods for generating query/form-data/path parts and part lists.
:::tip Example


```java
import static org.apache.juneau.http.HttpParts.*;

PartList formData =
    partList(  // Arbitrary list of parts
        stringPart("Name", "Bill")   // Freeform part
        integerPart("Age", () -> calculateAge())   // Freeform part with supplied value
    );
```


The following methods are provided for creating parts.  Each accepts
either static values or values from [Suppliers](../apidocs/java/util/function/Supplier.html):
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpParts#basicPart(String,Object) basicPart\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpParts#booleanPart(String,Boolean) booleanPart\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpParts#csvArrayPart(String,String...) csvArrayPart\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpParts#datePart(String,ZonedDateTime) datePart\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpParts#integerPart(String,Integer) integerPart\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpParts#longPart(String,Long) longPart\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpParts#serializedPart(String,Object) serializedPart\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpParts#stringPart(String,String) stringPart\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpParts#uriPart(String,URI) uriPart\}

The \{@link oaj.http.HttpParts#serializedPart(String,Object) serializedPart\} methods allows for parts
serialized using schema-based serializers such as the OpenAPI serializer.
Lists of parts can be produced with the following methods:
- [partList()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpParts.html#partList())
- [partList(List)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpParts.html#partList(List))
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpParts#partList(NameValuePair...) partList(NameValuePair...)\}
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpParts#partList(String...) partList(String...)\}

The capabilities of the [PartList](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/PartList.html) class is described later.

### HttpEntities

The [HttpEntities](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpEntities.html) class contains convenience static methods for generating HTTP message entities.
Returned objects extend from  \{@code org.apache.http.HttpEntity\} but provides the following additional features: - Caching.
- Fluent setters.
- Fluent assertions.
- Externally-supplied/dynamic content.
The following methods are provided for creating entities.
Each accepts either static values or values from [Suppliers](../apidocs/java/util/function/Supplier.html) and returns builders:
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpEntities#byteArrayEntity(byte[]) byteArrayEntity\}
- [fileEntity](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpEntities.html#fileEntity(File))
- [readerEntity](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpEntities.html#readerEntity(Reader))
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpEntities#serializedEntity(Object, Serializer) serializedEntity\}
- [streamEntity](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpEntities.html#streamEntity(InputStream))
- [stringEntity](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpEntities.html#stringEntity(String))

HTTP entities are automatically supported in both the server and client REST APIs for requests and responses.
:::tip Example


```java
import static org.apache.juneau.http.HttpResources.*;

@RestDelete(path="/{id}")
public HttpEntity helloWold(...) {
    return stringEntity("Hello!").contentType("text/plain");
}
```


:::

### HttpResources

The [HttpResources](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpResources.html) class contains convenience static methods for generating HTTP message resources.
Returned objects extend from [HttpResource](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/resource/HttpResource.html) which extends from [HttpEntity](../apidocs/org/apache/http/HttpEntity.html) but with additional arbitrary headers.
The following methods are provided for creating entities.
Each accepts either static values or values from [Suppliers](../apidocs/java/util/function/Supplier.html) and are in the form of builders.
- \{@link oaj.http.HttpResources#byteArrayResource(byte[]) byteArrayResource\}
- [fileResource](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpResources.html#fileResource(File))
- [readerResource](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpResources.html#readerResource(Reader))
- [streamResource](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpResources.html#streamResource(InputStream))
- [stringResource](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpResources.html#stringResource(String))

The most common location where resources are used are as returned types of REST operation methods described later.
:::tip Example


```java
import static org.apache.juneau.http.HttpResources.*;

@RestDelete(path="/{id}")
public HttpResource helloWold(...) {
    return stringResource("Hello!").contentType("text/plain").header("Cache-Control", "none");
}
```


:::
