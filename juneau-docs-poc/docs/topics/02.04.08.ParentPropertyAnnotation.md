title: "@ParentProperty Annotation"
---

The [@ParentProperty]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/annotation/ParentProperty.html) annotation is used to identify a
setter as a method for adding a parent reference to a child object.

A commonly-used case is when you're parsing beans and a child bean has a reference to a parent bean.

```java
public class AddressBook {
    public List people;
}

public class Person {

    @ParentProperty
    public AddressBook addressBook;  // A reference to the containing address book.

    public String name;

    public char sex;
}
```

Parsers will automatically set this field for you in the child beans.
