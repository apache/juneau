title: "POJO Builders"
---

Juneau parsers can use builders to instantiate POJOs.
This is useful in cases where you want to create beans with read-only properties.

Note that while it's possible to do this using the [@Beanc](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Beanc.html) annotation, using builders can often be cleaner.

A typical builder usage is shown below:

```java
MyBean bean = MyBean.create().foo("foo").bar(123).build();
```

The typical code for such a builder using a static inner class is shown below:

```java
public class MyBean {

    // Read-only properties.
    public final String foo;
    public final int bar;

    // Private constructor.
    private MyBean(Builder builder) {
        this.foo = builder.foo;
        this.bar = builder.bar;
    }

    // Static method that creates a builder.
    public static Builder create() {
        return new Builder();
    }

    // Builder class.
    public static class Builder {
        String foo;
        int bar;

        // Method that creates the bean.
        public MyBean build() {
            return new MyBean(this);
        }

        // Bean property setters.

        @Beanp
        public Builder foo(String foo) {
            this.foo = foo;
            return this;
        }

        @Beanp
        public Builder bar(int bar) {
            this.bar = bar;
            return this;
        }
    }
}
```

The POJO class can be any type including beans.
Builders MUST be beans with one or more writable properties.
 - The bean properties themselves do not need to be readable (i.e. getters are optional).

Builders require two parts:
- A way to detect and instantiate a builder using reflection.
- A way to instantiate a POJO from a builder.

The first can be accomplished through **any** of the following:
- A static `create()` method on the POJO class that returns a builder instance. `public static Builder create() {...}`
- A public constructor on the POJO class that takes in a single parameter that implements the [Builder](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/swap/Builder.html) interface.
   - The builder class must have a public no-arg constructor. `public MyBean(Builder builder) {...}`
   - A [@Builder](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Builder.html) annotation on the POJO class to explicitly identify it.`@Builder(Builder.class) public class MyBean {...}`
   - The builder class must have a public no-arg constructor.

The second can be accomplished through **any** of the following:
- The existence of a public constructor on the POJO class that takes in the builder instance. `public MyBean(Builder builder) {...}`
