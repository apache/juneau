title: "HTTP Status Codes"
---

By default, a 200 (OK) status is automatically set as the HTTP status when a Java method executes successfully.
Other status codes can be generated by throwing a [BasicHttpException]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/http/response/BasicHttpException.html) with a specific HTTP status code, or calling [HttpServletResponse.setStatus(int)]({{API_DOCS}}/jakarta/servlet/http/HttpServletResponse.html#setStatus(int)).
Non-OK (200) status codes are automatically triggered by the following conditions: Code Description When triggered 401 Unauthorized A [guard]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/guard/RestGuard.html) prevented the method from being executed 404 Not Found No matching path patterns were found on any method 405 Method Not Implemented A path pattern matched but no Java methods were found for the HTTP method 406 Not Acceptable A path pattern matched but no Java methods were found with a matching serializer for the Accept on the request 412 Precondition Failed A path pattern matched but no Java methods were found that were not rejected by [matchers]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/matcher/RestMatcher.html) 415 Unsupported Media Type A path pattern matched but no Java methods were found with a matching parser for the Content-Type on the request 500 Internal Server Error The Java method threw an exception other than [BasicHttpException]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/http/response/BasicHttpException.html)
