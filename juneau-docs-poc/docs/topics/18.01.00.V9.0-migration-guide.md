The following guide can be used to help migrate your code to v9.0.
Note that you can also refer to the Release Notes for changes as well.
| Old | New |
|-----|-----|
| [@RestMethod](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestMethod.html) annotation. | Has been replaced with [RestOp](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestOp.html), [RestGet](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestGet.html), [RestPut](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestPut.html), [RestPost](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestPost.html), [RestDelete](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestDelete.html), [RestOptions](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestOptions.html) |
| [@RemoteMethod](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteMethod.html) annotation. | Has been replaced with [RemoteOp](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteOp.html), [RemoteGet](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteGet.html), [RemotePut](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemotePut.html), [RemotePost](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemotePost.html), [RemoteDelete](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteDelete.html). |
| `BasicRestServletJena`, `BasicRestServletJenaGroup` classes. | These have been removed in 9.0 due to the removal of the Jena packages (due to security issues).<br />Replace with [BasicRestServlet](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestServlet.html) and [BasicRestServletGroup](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestServletGroup.html). |
| [@Body](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Body.html) annotation. | Has been renamed to [@Content](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Content.html) (to better match HTTP naming conventions such as Content-Type/Content-Encoding headers). |
| `@Query(_default)`, `@FormData(_default)`. | Has been renamed to [Query.def](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Query.html#def) / [FormData.def](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/FormData.html#def).<br />Note however that [@RestOp](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestOp.html)-annotated parameters now also support use of Optional parameters which simplifies the coding of default values. |
| `@Rest(reqHeaders)`. | Has been renamed to [Rest.defaultRequestHeaders](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html#defaultRequestHeaders) and added [Rest.defaultResponseHeaders](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html#defaultResponseHeaders). |
| `@Rest(staticFiles)`. | Changed from a string array to a `Class<? extends StaticFiles>`.<br />If you're extending from [BasicRestServlet](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestServlet.html)/[BasicRestObject](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestObject.html), the [getHtdoc()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestOperations.html#getHtdoc(String,Locale)) is already implemented for you to provide static files under the sub-URI /htdocs/*.<br />The default implementation for finding static files is [BasicStaticFiles](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/staticfile/BasicStaticFiles.html) which provides basic out-of-the-box functionality, so you can usually just remove the previous `@Rest(staticFiles)` value. |
