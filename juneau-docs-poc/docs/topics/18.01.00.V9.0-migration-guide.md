title: "v9.0 Migration Guide"
---

The following guide can be used to help migrate your code to v9.0.
Note that you can also refer to the Release Notes for changes as well.
Old New @RestMethod annotation.
Has been replaced with [RestOp]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestOp.html), [RestGet]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestGet.html), [RestPut]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestPut.html), [RestPost]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestPost.html), [RestDelete]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestDelete.html), [RestOptions]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestOptions.html) @RemoteMethod annotation.
Has been replaced with [RemoteOp]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteOp.html), [RemoteGet]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteGet.html), [RemotePut]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemotePut.html), [RemotePost]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemotePost.html), [RemoteDelete]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteDelete.html).
`BasicRestServletJena`, `BasicRestServletJenaGroup` classes.
These have been removed in 9.0 due to the removal of the Jena packages (due to security issues).
Replace with [BasicRestServlet]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestServlet.html) and [BasicRestServletGroup]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestServletGroup.html).
@Body annotation.
Has been renamed to @Content (to better match HTTP naming conventions such as Content-Type/Content-Encoding headers).
`@Query(_default)`, `@FormData(_default)`.
Has been renamed to [Query#def]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Query.html#def) / [FormData#def]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/FormData.html#def).
Note however that @RestOp-annotated parameters now also support use of Optional parameters which simplifies the coding of default values.
`@Rest(reqHeaders)`.
Has been renamed to [Rest#defaultRequestHeaders]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html#defaultRequestHeaders) and added [Rest#defaultResponseHeaders]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html#defaultResponseHeaders).
@Rest(staticFiles).
Changed from a string array to a `Class<?
extends StaticFiles>`.
If you're extending from [BasicRestServlet]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestServlet.html)/[BasicRestObject]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestObject.html), the \{@link oajr.servlet.BasicRestOperations#getHtdoc(String,Locale)\} is already implemented for you to provide static files under the sub-URI /htdocs/*.
The default implementation for finding static files is [BasicStaticFiles]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/staticfile/BasicStaticFiles.html) which provides basic out-of-the-box functionality, so you can usually just remove the previous `@Rest(staticFiles)` value.
