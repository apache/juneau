These headers extend from the following classes that provide data-type specific functionality:

<tree>
<node-0><java-interface>[NameValuePair](API_DOCS/org/apache/http/NameValuePair.html)</java-interface></node-0>
<node-1><java-interface>[Header](API_DOCS/org/apache/http/Header.html)</java-interface></node-1>
<node-2><java-class>[BasicHeader](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/BasicHeader.html)</java-class></node-2>

</tree>

#### Creator Methods

Static methods are provided on [HttpHeaders](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpHeaders.html) to simplify creation
of headers:

<tree>
<node-0><java-class>[HttpHeaders](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpHeaders.html)</java-class></node-0>
<node-1><java-method>[accept(String)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpHeaders.html#accept(String))</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[authorization(String)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpHeaders.html#authorization(String))</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[contentType(String)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpHeaders.html#contentType(String))</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[userAgent(String)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpHeaders.html#userAgent(String))</java-method></node-1>
</tree>

These subclasses provide various convenience methods to allow for easy fluent-style coding.

:::tip Examples
```java
// Validates the response body content is not expired.
restClient
    .get(URL)
    .run()
    .getHeader("Expires").asDateHeader().assertZonedDateTime().isLessThan(new Date());
```
:::

#### HeaderList

The [HeaderList](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html) class is a list of HTTP headers.

:::tip Example
```java
// Construct using builder.
HeaderList headers = HeaderList
    .create()
    .append(Accept.of("text/xml"))
    .append("Content-Type", ()->getDynamicContentTypeFromSomewhere());

// Construct using convenience creator.
HeaderList headers = HeaderList.of(Accept.TEXT_XML, ContentType.TEXT_XML);
```
:::

Static methods are provided on [HttpHeaders](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpHeaders.html) to further simplify
creation of header lists.

```java
import static org.apache.juneau.http.HttpHeaders.*;

HeaderList headers = headerList(accept("text/xml"), contentType("text/xml"));
```

The builder class supports setting default header values (i.e. add a header to the list if it isn't otherwise in the
list).
Note that this is different from simply setting a value twice as using default values will not overwrite existing
headers.

The following example notes the distinction:

```java
headers = HeaderList
    .create()
    .set(Accept.TEXT_PLAIN)
    .set(Accept.TEXT_XML);
assertObject(headers).isString("[Accept: text/xml]");

headers = HeaderList
    .create()
    .set(Accept.TEXT_PLAIN)
    .setDefault(Accept.TEXT_XML);
assertObject(headers).isString("[Accept: text/plain]");
```

Various methods are provided for iterating over the headers in this list to avoid array copies.

<tree>
<node-0><java-class>[HeaderList](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html)</java-class></node-0>
<node-1><java-method>[forEach(Consumer)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html#forEach(Consumer))</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[forEach(String,Consumer)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html#forEach(String,Consumer))</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[forEach(Predicate,Consumer)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html#forEach(Predicate,Consumer))</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[headerIterator()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html#headerIterator())</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[headerIterator(String)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html#headerIterator(String))</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[stream()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html#stream())</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[stream(String)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html#stream(String))</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[getAll()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html#getAll())</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[getAll(String)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html#getAll(String))</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[get(String)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html#get(String))</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[get(Class)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html#get(Class))</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[get(String,Class)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html#get(String,Class))</java-method></node-1>
</tree>

In general, try to use these over the [getAll()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html#getAll()) / [getAll(String)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html#getAll(String)) methods that require array copies.

Similar to the way multiple parts can be collapsed into a single value, the [get(String)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html#get(String)) method is special in that it will collapse multiple headers with the same name into a single comma-delimited list (see RFC 2616 Section 4.2 for rules).

The [get(Class)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html#get(Class)) and [get(String,Class)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html#get(String,Class)) methods are provided for working with [Header](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Header.html)-annotated beans.

:::tip Example
```java
HeaderList headers = HeaderList.of(Accept.TEXT_JSON, Accept.TEXT_XML);

// Returns "text/json, text/xml"
Accept accept = headers.get(Accept.class);
```
:::

By default, header names are treated as case-insensitive.
This can be changed using the [caseSensitive(boolean)](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html#caseSensitive(boolean)) method.

A [VarResolver](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/svl/VarResolver.html) can be associated with this builder to create
header values with embedded variables that are resolved at runtime.

:::tip Example
```java
// Create a header list with dynamically-resolving values pulled from a system property.

System.setProperty("foo", "bar");

HeaderList headers = HeaderList
    .create()
    .resolving()
    .append("X1", "$S{foo}")
    .append("X2", ()->"$S{foo}");

assertObject(headers).isString("[X1: bar, X2: bar]");
```
:::

The [HeaderList](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/header/HeaderList.html) object can be extended to defined
pre-packaged lists of headers which can be used in various annotations throughout the framework.

:::tip Example
```java
// A predefined list of headers.
public class MyHeaderList extends HeaderList {
    public MyHeaderList() {
        super(Accept.TEXT_XML, ContentType.TEXT_XML);
    }
}

// Use it on a remote proxy to add headers on all requests.
@Remote(path="/petstore", headerList=MyHeaderList.class)
public interface PetStore {

    @RemotePost("/pets")
    Pet addPet(
        @Content CreatePet createPet,
        @Header("E-Tag") UUID etag,
        @Query("debug") boolean debug
    );
}
```
