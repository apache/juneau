title: "VarResolvers and VarResolverSessions"
---

The main class for performing variable resolution is [VarResolver]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/svl/VarResolver.html).
Two methods are provided for resolving variables:

<tree>
<node-0><java-class>[VarResolver]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/svl/VarResolver.html)</java-class></node-0>
<node-1><java-method>[resolve(String)]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/svl/VarResolver.html#resolve(String))</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[resolveTo(String,Writer)]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/svl/VarResolver.html#resolveTo(String,Writer))</java-method></node-1>
</tree>

Var resolvers can rely on the existence of other objects.
For example, [ConfigVar]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/config/vars/ConfigVar.html) relies on the existence of a [Config]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/config/Config.html).
This is accomplished through the following method:
- [Builder]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/svl/VarResolver/Builder.html)
- \{@link oaj.svl.VarResolver.Builder#bean(Class,Object) bean(Class, T)\} - Specify a bean for all sessions.
- [VarResolverSession]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/svl/VarResolverSession.html)
- \{@link oaj.svl.VarResolverSession#bean(Class,Object) bean(Class, T)\} - Specify a bean for this session.

Beans are accessible through the following method:
- [VarResolverSession#getBean(Class)]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/svl/VarResolverSession.html#getBean(Class))

Var resolvers can be cloned and extended by using the [VarResolver#copy()]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/svl/VarResolver.html#copy()) method.
Cloning a resolver will copy it's [Var]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/svl/Var.html) class names and context objects.
:::tip Example


```java
// Create a resolver that copies the default resolver and adds $C and $A vars.
VarResolver myVarResolver = VarResolver
    .DEFAULT
    .copy()
    .vars(ConfigVar.class, ArgsVar.class)
    .build();

```
