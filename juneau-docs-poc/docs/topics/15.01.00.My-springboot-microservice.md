### Starter Project Zip

my-springboot-microservice-9.0.1.zip The my-springboot-microservice.zip file is a predefined starter Eclipse project for developing REST microservices using the juneau-rest-server-springboot package with Spring Boot.
It includes a combination of the Juneau Core, Server, and Client APIs and all libraries needed to execute in a Java 1.8+ environment.
One significant difference is that we are not using the Juneau [Microservice]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice.html) API for our application but instead using the existing Spring Boot API.
