title: "HTTP Parts"
---

The [part](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part.html) package contains implementations of `org.apache.http.NameValuePair` to be used for query/form-data/path parts and part lists.
- \{@code org.apache.http.NameValuePair\}
- [BasicPart](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/BasicPart.html)
- [BasicBooleanPart](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/BasicBooleanPart.html)
- [BasicCsvArrayPart](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/BasicCsvArrayPart.html)
- [BasicDatePart](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/BasicDatePart.html)
- [BasicIntegerPart](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/BasicIntegerPart.html)
- [BasicLongPart](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/BasicLongPart.html)
- [BasicPartIterator](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/BasicPartIterator.html)

- [BasicUriPart](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/BasicUriPart.html)

### PartList

The [PartList](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/PartList.html) class is a list of HTTP parts (form-data, query-parameters, path-parameters).
:::tip Example


```java
PartList parts = PartList
    .create()
    .append(MyPart.of("foo"))
    .append("Bar", ()->getDynamicValueFromSomewhere());
```


Convenience creators are provided for creating lists with minimal code:

```java
PartList parts = PartList.of(BasicIntegerPart.of("foo", 1));
```


Static methods are provided on [HttpParts](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/HttpParts.html) to further simplify creation of part lists.

```java
import static org.apache.juneau.http.HttpParts.*;

PartList parts = partList(integerPart("foo", 1), booleanPart("bar", false));
```


The builder class supports setting default part values (i.e. add a part to the list if it isn't otherwise in the list).
Note that this is different from simply setting a value twice as using default values will not overwrite existing
parts.
The following example notes the distinction:

```java
parts = PartList
    .create()
    .set("Foo", "bar")
    .set("Foo", "baz");
assertObject(parts).isString("foo=baz");

parts = PartList
    .create()
    .set("Foo", "bar")
    .setDefault("Foo", "baz");
assertObject(parts).isString("foo=bar");
```


Various methods are provided for iterating over the parts in this list to avoid array copies.
- [forEach(Consumer)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/PartList.html#forEach(Consumer)) / \{@link oaj.http.part.PartList#forEach(String,Consumer) forEach(String,Consumer)\} / \{@link oaj.http.part.PartList#forEach(Predicate,Consumer) forEach(Predicate,Consumer)\} - Use consumers to process parts.
- [partIterator()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/PartList.html#partIterator()) / [partIterator(String)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/PartList.html#partIterator(String)) - Use an [PartIterator](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/PartIterator.html) to process parts.
- [stream()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/PartList.html#stream()) / [stream(String)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/PartList.html#stream(String)) - Use a stream.

In general, try to use these over the [getAll()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/PartList.html#getAll()) / [getAll(String)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/PartList.html#getAll(String)) methods that require array copies.
Similar to the way multiple headers can be collapsed into a single value, the [get(String)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/PartList.html#get(String)) method is special in that it will collapse multiple parts with the same name into
a single comma-delimited list.
The [get(Class)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/PartList.html#get(Class)) and \{@link oaj.http.part.PartList#get(String,Class) get(String,Class)\} methods are provided for working with [FormData](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/FormData.html) / [Query](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Query.html) / [Path](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Path.html)-annotated
:::

beans.
:::tip Example


```java
MyQueryBean foo = parts.get(MyQueryBean.class);
```


A [VarResolver](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/svl/VarResolver.html) can be associated with this builder to create part values with embedded variables that
are resolved at runtime.
:::

:::tip Example


```java
// Create a part list with dynamically-resolving values pulled from a system property.

System.setProperty("foo", "bar");

PartList parts = PartList
    .create()
    .resolving()
    .append("X1", "$S{foo}")
    .append("X2", ()->"$S{foo}");

assertObject(parts).isString("X1=bar&X2=bar");
```


The [PartList](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part/PartList.html) object can be extended to defined pre-packaged lists of parts which can be used in various
annotations throughout the framework.
:::

:::tip Example


```java
// A predefined list of parts.
public class MyPartList extends PartList {
    public MyPartList() {
        super(BasicIntegerPart.of("foo",1), BasicBooleanPart.of("bar",false));
    }
}

```
