title: "Building and Running from Command-Line"
---

The pom.xml file is a basic Maven build script for creating your microservice as an executable uber-jar.
The easiest way to build your microservice is to run the following from the project root.

```bash
mvn clean install
```

Your `target` directory should now contain the following files:

- `my-jetty-microservice-1.0.jar`
- `mjm.cfg`

To start from a command line, run the following command from inside your `target` directory:

```bash
java -jar my-jetty-microservice-1.0.jar
```

You should see the following console output:

```bash
Running class 'JettyMicroservice' using config file 'mjm.cfg'.
Server started on port 10000

List of available commands:
    exit -- Shut down service
    restart -- Restarts service
    help -- Commands help

>
```

If you get this error message: java.net.BindException: Address already in use, then this microservice is already running elsewhere and so it cannot bind to port 10000.
