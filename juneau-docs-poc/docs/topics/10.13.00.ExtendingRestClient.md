title: "Extending RestClient"
---

The `RestClient` API has been designed to allow for the ability to be easily extended.
The following example that overrides the primary run method shows how this can be done.
:::tip Example


```java
public class MyRestClient extends RestClient {

    // Must provide this constructor!
    public MyRestClient(ContextProperties ps) {
        super(ps);
    }

    @Override
    public HttpResponse run(HttpHost target, HttpRequest request, HttpContext context) throws IOException {
        // Perform special handling of requests.
    }
}

// Instantiate your client.
MyRestClient client = RestClient.create().json().build(MyRestClient.class);
```


The [RestRequest]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestRequest.html) and [RestResponse]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestResponse.html) objects can also be extended and integrated by overriding the
\{@link oajrc.RestClient#createRequest(URI, String, boolean)\} and \{@link oajrc.RestClient#createResponse(RestRequest, HttpResponse, Parser)\} methods.
