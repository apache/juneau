title: "Extending RestClient"
---

The `RestClient` API has been designed to allow for the ability to be easily extended.

The following example that overrides the primary run method shows how this can be done.

:::tip Example
```java
public class MyRestClient extends RestClient {

    // Must provide this constructor!
    public MyRestClient(ContextProperties ps) {
        super(ps);
    }

    @Override
    public HttpResponse run(HttpHost target, HttpRequest request, HttpContext context) throws IOException {
        // Perform special handling of requests.
    }
}

// Instantiate your client.
MyRestClient client = RestClient.create().json().build(MyRestClient.class);
```
:::

The [RestRequest]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestRequest.html) and [RestResponse]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestResponse.html) objects can also be extended and integrated by overriding the
[createRequest(URI, String, boolean)]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient.html#createRequest(URI,String,boolean)) and [createResponse(RestRequest, HttpResponse, Parser)]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient.html#createResponse(RestRequest,HttpResponse,Parser)) methods.
