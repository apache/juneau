title: "@BeanIgnore Annotation"
---

The [@BeanIgnore](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/annotation/BeanIgnore.html) annotation is used to
ignore classes, fields, and methods from being interpreted as beans or bean components.

When applied to classes, objects will be converted to strings even though they look like beans.

```java
// Not really a bean!  Use toString() instead!
@BeanIgnore
public class MyBean {...}
```

When applied to fields and getters/setters, they will be ignored as bean properties.

```java
public class MyBean {

    // Not a bean property!
    @BeanIgnore
    public String foo;

    // Not a bean property!
    @BeanIgnore
    public String getBar() {...}
}
```
