Converters can be thought of as "post-processors" for response POJOs before they get passed to the serializer.
Converters are associated with resource classes and methods via the following:
- [Rest](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html)
- [converters](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html#converters())
- [RestOp](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestOp.html)
- [converters](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestOp.html#converters())

:::tip Example


```java
// GET person request handler.
// Traversable conversion enabled to allow nodes in returned POJO tree to be addressed.
// Queryable conversion enabled to allow returned POJO to be searched/viewed/sorted.
@RestGet(
    path="/people/{id}/*",
    converters={Traversable.class,Queryable.class}
)
public Person getPerson(@Path("id") int id) {
    return findPerson(id);
}
```


Juneau defines the following converters out-of-the-box:
- [RestConverter](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/converter/RestConverter.html)

-
[Queryable](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/converter/Queryable.html)
Provides query parameters that can be used to transform the response (i.e. search/view/sort the
POJO response before being serialized).
-
[Traversable](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/converter/Traversable.html)
Allows nodes in the POJO response tree to be individually accessed through additional path info on
the request.
-
[Introspectable](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/converter/Introspectable.html)
Allows method calls to be made on the response POJO, and for the result of that method call to be
serialized as the response.
