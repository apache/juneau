title: "@Response"
---

The [@Response](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Response.html) annotation can be applied to types returned by @RemoteOp-annotated methods.
- [Response](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Response.html)
- [parser](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Response.html#parser()) - Override the part parser.

The @Response annotation can be used to define interfaces for retrieving response parts using a bean-like proxy.
:::tip Example


```java
@Remote
public interface PetStore {

    @RemotePost
    CreatePetResponse postPet(...);
}
```


```java
@Response
public interface CreatePetResponse {

    @Content
    Pet getContent();

    @Header("E-Tag")
    UUID getUUID();

    @StatusCode
    int getStatus();
}
```


```java
PetStore store = client.getRemote(PetStore.class, "http://localhost:10000");

CreatePetResponse response = store.postPet(...);
Pet pet = response.getContent();
UUID uuid = response.getUUID();
int status = response.getStatus();
```


The annotated methods must be no-arg.
They can be named anything.
Any of the following annotations can be used on the methods:
- [Content](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Content.html)
- [Header](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Header.html)
- [StatusCode](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/StatusCode.html)

The behavior and functionality of all of the annotations are the same as if they were used on method arguments directly. This means full support for OpenAPI serialization and validation.
