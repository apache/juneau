title: "JSON 5"
---

The [Json5Serializer]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/json/Json5Serializer.html) class can be used to serialized POJOs into JSON 5 notation.
JSON 5 is similar to JSON except for the following:

- JSON attributes are only quoted when necessary.
- Uses single-quotes for quoting.

:::tip Examples
```java
// Some free-form JSON.
JsonMap map = JsonMap.of(
    "foo", "x1",
    "_bar", "x2",
    " baz ", "x3",
    "123", "x4",
    "return", "x5",
    "", "x6"
);
```

```js
// Serialized to standard JSON
{
    "foo": "x1",
    "_bar": "x2",
    " baz ": "x3",
    "123": "x4",
    "return": "x5",
    "": "x6"
}
```

```js
// Serialized to simplified JSON
{
    foo: 'x1',
    _bar: 'x2',
    ' baz ': 'x3',  // Quoted due to embedded spaces.
    '123': 'x4',    // Quoted to prevent confusion with number.
    'return': 'x5', // Quoted because it's a keyword.
    '': 'x6'        // Quoted because it's an empty string.
}
```

The advantage to JSON 5 is you can represent it in a Java String in minimal form with minimal escaping.
This is particularly useful in cases such as unit testing where you can easily validate POJOs by simplifying them to JSON 5 and do a simple string comparison.

```java
WriterSerializer serializer = Json5Serializer.DEFAULT;
assertEquals("{foo:'bar',baz:123}", serializer.toString(myPojo));
```
