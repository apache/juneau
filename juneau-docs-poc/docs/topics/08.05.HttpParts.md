title: "HTTP Parts"
---

In previous examples we showed the ability to pass in annotated parameters on [RestOp](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestOp.html)-annotated methods
to parse standard HTTP parts:
:::tip Example


```java
@RestGet("/example1/{a1}/*")
public String doGetExample1(
    @Path("a1") String a1,
    @Query("p1") int p1,
    @HasQuery("p2") boolean hasP3,
    @Path("/*") String remainder,
    @Header("Accept-Language") String lang
) {
    // Do something with all of those
}
```


Annotations are provided for both request and response HTTP parts.
The annotations used for defining the schema for request HTTP parts are:
- HTTP request parts:
- [Request](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Request.html)
- [Content](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Content.html)
- [Header](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Header.html)
- [FormData](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/FormData.html)
- [Query](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Query.html)
- [Path](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Path.html)
- [HasFormData](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/HasFormData.html)
- [HasQuery](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/HasQuery.html)
- HTTP response parts:
- [Response](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Response.html)
- [Content](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Content.html)
- [Header](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Header.html)
- [StatusCode](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/StatusCode.html)

These annotation can be used on method parameters or on the parameter types themselves, or a combination
of both.

:::

:::note
When defined on types, annotations are aggregated from parent to child with child values
taking precedence.  When defined on both, annotations are aggregated with values on parameters
taking precedence.
