title: "JSON Methodology"

The JSON data type produced depends on the Java object type being serialized.

- Primitives and primitive objects are converted to JSON primitives.
- Beans and `Maps` are converted to JSON objects.
- `Collections` and arrays are converted to JSON arrays.
- Anything else is converted to JSON strings.

##### Data type conversions:

| POJO type | JSON type | Example | Serialized form |
|-----------|-----------|---------|----------------|
| String | String | `serialize("foobar");` | `'foobar'` |
| Number | Number | `serialize(123);` | `123` |
| Boolean | Boolean | `serialize(true);` | `true` |
| Null | Null | `serialize(null);` | `null` |
| Beans with properties of any type on this list | Object | `serialize(new MyBean());` | `{p1:'val1',p2:true}` |
| `Maps` with values of any type on this list | Object | `serialize(new TreeMap());` | `{key1:'val1',key2:true}` |
| `Collections` and arrays of any type on this list | Array | `serialize(new Object[]{1,"foo",true});` | `[1,'foo',true]` |

In addition, swaps can be used to convert non-serializable POJOs into serializable forms, such as converting `Calendar`
object to ISO8601 strings, or `byte[]` arrays to Base-64 encoded strings.
