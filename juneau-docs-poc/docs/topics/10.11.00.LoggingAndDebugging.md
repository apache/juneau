title: "Logging and Debugging"

The following methods provide logging of requests and responses:
<tree>
<node-0><java-class>[RestClient.Builder](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html)</java-class></node-0>
<node-1><java-method>[logger(Logger)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#logger(Logger))</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[logToConsole()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#logToConsole())</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[logRequests(DetailLevel,Level,BiPredicate)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#logRequests(DetailLevel,Level,BiPredicate))</java-method></node-1>
</tree>

The following example shows the results of logging all requests that end with `/bean`.
:::tip Examples


```java
// A simple bean we're going to round-trip.
MyBean bean = new MyBean();

bean = RestClient
    .create()
    .json5()
    .logRequests(DetailLevel.FULL, Level.SEVERE, (req,res)->req.getUri().endsWith("/bean"))
    .logToConsole()
    .build()
    .post("http://localhost/bean", bean)
    .run()
    .getContent().as(MyBean.class);
```


This produces the following console output:

```bash
=== HTTP Call (outgoing) ======================================================
=== REQUEST ===
POST http://localhost/bean
---request headers---
    Accept: application/json5
---request entity---
Content-Type: application/json5
---request content---
{f:1}
=== RESPONSE ===
HTTP/1.1 200
---response headers---
    Content-Type: application/json
---response content---
{f:1}
=== END =======================================================================",
```


It should be noted that if you enable request logging detail level [DetailLevel#FULL](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/DetailLevel.html#FULL), response bodies will be cached by default which may introduce
a performance penalty.
Additionally, the following method is also provided for enabling debug mode:
<tree>
<node-0><java-class>[RestClient.Builder](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html)</java-class></node-0>
<node-1><java-method>[debug()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#debug())</java-method></node-1>
</tree>

Enabling debug mode has the following effects:
- [Builder#logToConsole()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#logToConsole()) is called.
