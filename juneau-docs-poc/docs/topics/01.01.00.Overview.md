### About

Apache Juneau™ is a single cohesive Java ecosystem for marshalling Java objects to a wide variety of language types and creating annotation-based REST end-to-end server and client APIs.

The Juneau ecosystem consists of the following parts:

| Category | Maven Artifacts | Description | Prerequisites |
|----------|------------------|-------------|---------------|
| **juneau-core** | `juneau-marshall` | Serializers and parsers for JSON (various flavors), XML, HTML, URL-Encoding, UON, OpenAPI, PlainText, CSV, SOAP, and MessagePack. | Apache HttpCore 4.4 |
| | `juneau-marshall-rdf` | Serializers and parsers for RDF/XML (various flavors), N3, NTriple, and Turtle. | Apache HttpCore 4.4<br/>Apache Jena 2.7.1 |
| | `juneau-dto` | Data Transfer Objects for HTML5, Atom, Cognos, JSON-Schema, and Swagger | *None* |
| | `juneau-config` | Configuration File API | *None* |
| | `juneau-assertions` | Fluent-style assertions API | *None* |
| **juneau-rest** | `juneau-rest-common` | REST APIs common to client and server side. | Apache HttpCore 4.4 |
| | `juneau-rest-server` | REST Servlet API | Servlet 3.1+ |
| | `juneau-rest-server-springboot` | REST Spring Boot integration | Spring Boot 2.0+ |
| | `juneau-rest-client` | REST Client API | Apache HttpClient 4.5 |
| | `juneau-rest-mock` | REST Testing API | Apache HttpClient 4.5 |
| **my-springboot-microservice** | | Spring Boot developer template | Spring Boot 2.0+ |
| **juneau-examples** | `juneau-examples-core` | Core code examples | |
| | `juneau-examples-rest` | REST code examples | |
| **juneau-all** | `juneau-all` | Combination of the following:<br/>• juneau-marshall<br/>• juneau-dto<br/>• juneau-config<br/>• juneau-assertions<br/>• juneau-rest-common<br/>• juneau-rest-server<br/>• juneau-rest-client | Servlet 3.1+<br/>Apache HttpClient 4.5+ |

The current version of Juneau is `9.0.1`.
The easiest way to pull in the library is through the following maven dependency:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.juneau</groupId>
    <artifactId>juneau-all</artifactId>
    <version>{{JUNEAU_VERSION}}</version>
</dependency>
```

If you would like to work with the bleeding-edge code, you can access the `9.0.2-SNAPSHOT` version through the following repository:

```xml
<pluginRepositories>
    <pluginRepository>
        <id>apache.snapshots</id>
        <url>http://repository.apache.org/snapshots/</url>
        <snapshots>
            <enabled>true</enabled>
            <updatePolicy>always</updatePolicy>
        </snapshots>
    </pluginRepository>
</pluginRepositories>
```

Each of the components are also packaged as stand-alone OSGi modules.

:::note Features

- Fast memory-efficient serialization.
- Fast, safe, memory-efficient parsing. Parsers are not susceptible to deserialization attacks.
- KISS is our mantra! No auto-wiring. No code generation. No dependency injection. Just add it to your classpath and use it. Extremely simple unit testing!
- Enjoyable to use
- Tiny - ~1MB
- Exhaustively tested
- Lots of up-to-date documentation and examples
- Minimal library dependencies making it ideal for use in uber-jars.
- Built on top of Servlet and Apache HttpClient APIs that allow you to use the newest HTTP/2 features such as request/response multiplexing and server push.
- All modules work with Java 8 through at least 18.
