title: "Customizing HttpClient"
---

Several methods are provided for customizing the underlying HTTP client and client builder classes:

<tree>
<java-class>[RestClient.Builder]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html)</java-class>
<node-1><java-method>[httpClientBuilder(HttpClientBuilder)]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#httpClientBuilder(HttpClientBuilder)) - Set the client builder yourself.</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[createHttpClientBuilder()]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#createHttpClientBuilder()) - Override to create the client builder.</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[createHttpClient()]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#createHttpClient()) - Override to create the client.</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>[createConnectionManager()]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#createConnectionManager()) - Override to create the connection management.</java-method></node-1>
</tree>

Additionally, all methods on the `HttpClientBuilder` class have been extended with fluent setters.
:::tip Example


```java
// Create a client with customized HttpClient settings.
MyBean bean = RestClient
    .create()
    .disableRedirectHandling()
    .connectionManager(myConnectionManager)
    .addInterceptorFirst(myHttpRequestInterceptor)
    .build();
```


Refer to the \{@code org.apache.http.client.impl.HttpClientBuilder\} docs for more information.
