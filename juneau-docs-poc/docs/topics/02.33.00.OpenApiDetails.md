Juneau supports converting arbitrary POJOs to and from strings using OpenAPI-based schema rules.
The relevant classes for using OpenAPI-based serialization are:
- [OpenApiSerializer](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/oapi/OpenApiSerializer.html) - Converts POJOs to strings.
- [OpenApiParser](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/oapi/OpenApiParser.html) - Converts strings to POJOs.
- [HttpPartSchema](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/httppart/HttpPartSchema.html) - Defines the schema for your POJO.

The [HttpPartSchema](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/httppart/HttpPartSchema.html) class is used to define the formatting and validations for a POJO.
It's used in conjunction with the serializer and parser to produce and consume HTTP parts based on OpenAPI rules.
Later in the rest-server and rest-client sections, we also describe how the following annotations can be applied to method parameters and class types to define the schema for various HTTP parts:
- [Content](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Content.html)
- [Header](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Header.html)
- [Query](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Query.html)
- [FormData](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/FormData.html)
- [Path](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Path.html)
- [Response](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Response.html)
