title: "Part Marshallers"

Juneau comes with three basic marshaller types for serializing and parsing Header, Query, Form, and Path parts:
- [HttpPartSerializer](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/httppart/HttpPartSerializer.html)
- [SimplePartSerializer](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/httppart/SimplePartSerializer.html) - Serializes directly to strings.
- [UonSerializer](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/uon/UonSerializer.html) - Serializes to UON notation.
- [OpenApiSerializer](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/oapi/OpenApiSerializer.html) - Serializes using Open-API schema rules.
- [HttpPartParser](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/httppart/HttpPartParser.html)
- [SimplePartParser](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/httppart/SimplePartParser.html) - Parses directly from strings.
- [UonParser](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/uon/UonParser.html) - Parses from UON notation.
- [OpenApiParser](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/oapi/OpenApiParser.html) - Parses using Open-API schema rules.

By default, the REST API uses the OpenAPI serializer and parser which allows for schema-based
marshalling.  You also have the option to use UON marshalling which is schema-less but allows
for JSON-equivalent data structures (object/array/primitives/...) using URL-encoding notation.
This can be done by overriding the part marshallers through the following APIs:
- [Rest](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html)
- [partSerializer](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html#partSerializer())
- [partParser](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html#partParser())
- [Builder](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/RestContext/Builder.html)
- [partSerializer(HttpPartSerializer)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/RestContext/Builder.html#partSerializer(HttpPartSerializer))
- [partParser(HttpPartParser)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/RestContext/Builder.html#partParser(HttpPartParser))

The OpenAPI marshallers themselves also have the ability to support UON notation for individual
parts via the schema itself:

```java
@Query(..., schema=@Schema(format="uon")) Map myMap

```
