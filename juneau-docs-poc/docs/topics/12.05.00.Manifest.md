The [Builder#manifest(Object)]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice/Builder.html#manifest(Object)) method can be used to specify the contents or location of of the main manifest file of the executable jar.
If you do not specify the location/contents of the manifest file, the microservice will attempt to resolve it through the following methods: - Looking on the file system for a file at "META-INF/MANIFEST.MF".
This is primarily to allow for running microservices from within eclipse workspaces where the manifest file is located in the project root.
- Using the class loader for this class to find the file at the URL "META-INF/MANIFEST.MF".
If you do manually specify the manifest file, you can pass in any of the following types:
- [ManifestFile]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/utils/ManifestFile.html) - A pre-parsed manifest file.
- [Manifest]({{API_DOCS}}/java/util/jar/Manifest.html) - A pre-parsed manifest file.
- [Reader]({{API_DOCS}}/java/io/Reader.html) - Containing the raw contents of the manifest.
- [InputStream]({{API_DOCS}}/java/io/InputStream.html) - Containing the raw contents of the manifest.
- [File]({{API_DOCS}}/java/io/File.html) - File containing the raw contents of the manifest.
- [String]({{API_DOCS}}/java/lang/String.html) - Path to file containing the raw contents of the manifest.
- [Class]({{API_DOCS}}/java/lang/Class.html) - Finds and loads the manifest file of the jar file that the specified class is contained within.

The manifest file can be retrieved using the the [Microservice#getManifest()]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice.html#getManifest()) method which provides an API for accessing manifest file entries.
This method returns an instance of [ManifestFile]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/utils/ManifestFile.html) which extends from [JsonMap]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/collections/JsonMap.html) allowing you to retrieve entries as any data types supported by that class.
:::tip Example


```java
ManifestFile manifestFile = Microservice.getInstance().getManifest();

String mainClass = manifestFile.getString("Main-Class");
int myInt = manifestFile.getInt("My-Int", 123);
boolean myBoolean = manifestFile.getBoolean("My-Boolean");
```


The manifest is also used for the [$MF]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/svl/vars/ManifestFileVar.html) SVL variable.

:::tip Examples


```java
// $MF used in variable resolver.
VarResolver var = Microservice.getInstance().getVarResolver();
System.out.println(vr.resolve("The main class is $MF{Main-Class}"));
```


```java
// $MF used in annotation.
@Rest(
    title="$MF{Application-Title}",
    ...
)

```
