The [Microservice.Builder.manifest(Object)]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice/Builder.html#manifest(Object))
method can be used to specify the contents or location of of the main manifest file of the executable jar.
If you do not specify the location/contents of the manifest file, the microservice will attempt to resolve it through
the following methods: - Looking on the file system for a file at `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`.
This is primarily to allow for running microservices from within eclipse workspaces where the manifest file is located
in the project root.

- Using the class loader for this class to find the file at the URL `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF`.

If you do manually specify the manifest file, you can pass in any of the following types:

<tree>
<node-0>Manifest File Types</node-0>
<node-1><java-class>[ManifestFile]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/utils/ManifestFile.html)</java-class> - A pre-parsed manifest file</node-1>
<node-1><java-class>[Manifest]({{API_DOCS}}/java/util/jar/Manifest.html)</java-class> - A pre-parsed manifest file</node-1>
<node-1><java-class>[Reader]({{API_DOCS}}/java/io/Reader.html)</java-class> - Containing the raw contents of the manifest</node-1>
<node-1><java-class>[InputStream]({{API_DOCS}}/java/io/InputStream.html)</java-class> - Containing the raw contents of the manifest</node-1>
<node-1><java-class>[File]({{API_DOCS}}/java/io/File.html)</java-class> - File containing the raw contents of the manifest</node-1>
<node-1><java-class>[String]({{API_DOCS}}/java/lang/String.html)</java-class> - Path to file containing the raw contents of the manifest</node-1>
<node-1><java-class>[Class]({{API_DOCS}}/java/lang/Class.html)</java-class> - Finds and loads the manifest file of the jar file that the specified class is contained within</node-1>
</tree>

The manifest file can be retrieved using the the [Microservice.getManifest()]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice.html#getManifest()) method which provides an API for accessing manifest file entries.
This method returns an instance of [ManifestFile]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/utils/ManifestFile.html) which extends
from [JsonMap]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/collections/JsonMap.html) allowing you to retrieve entries as any data
types supported by that class.

:::tip Example
```java
ManifestFile manifestFile = Microservice.getInstance().getManifest();

String mainClass = manifestFile.getString("Main-Class");
int myInt = manifestFile.getInt("My-Int", 123);
boolean myBoolean = manifestFile.getBoolean("My-Boolean");
```
:::

The manifest is also used for the [$MF]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/svl/vars/ManifestFileVar.html) SVL variable.

:::tip Examples
```java
// $MF used in variable resolver.
VarResolver var = Microservice.getInstance().getVarResolver();
System.out.println(vr.resolve("The main class is $MF{Main-Class}"));
```

```java
// $MF used in annotation.
@Rest(
    title="$MF{Application-Title}",
    ...
)
```
