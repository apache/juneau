title: "Annotations"
---

The [org.apache.juneau.http.annotation](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation.html) package contains annotations for defining both
server and client side APIs.

The server-side APIs also use it for producing auto-generated Swagger documentation through the REST API itself.

These annotations are used in a variety of places in the server and client side REST interfaces, especially for remote
proxies.
These will be described later in those sections.
