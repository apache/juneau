The [http](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http.html) package contains a slew of useful extensions to the Apache HttpComponents libraries
and define APIs used extensively in the REST server and client APIs.
- [http](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http.html) - Utility classes used for HTTP parts/headers/entities.
- [annotation](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation.html) - Swagger-based annotations used on both server-side APIs and client-side proxy interfaces.
- [entity](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/entity.html) - HTTP entity classes.
- [header](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/header.html) - HTTP header classes.
- [part](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/part.html) - HTTP query/form-data/path classes.
- [remote](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote.html) - Remote proxy interface API
- [resource](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/resource.html) - HTTP resource classes.
- [response](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/response.html) - HTTP response classes.

These APIs extend from the Apache HttpComponents libraries and can be used with libraries based on it such
as Apache HttpClient.  The REST Client API described later is built on top of Apache HttpClient and many
of the classes defined in this package make up integral components of that API.  Likewise, the APIs
defined here are also used in the REST Server APIs also described later.
