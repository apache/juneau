title: "@Html Annotation"
---

The [@Html](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/annotation/Html.html) annotation can be used to customize how POJOs are serialized to HTML on a per-class/field/method basis.
- [Html](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/annotation/Html.html)
- [anchorText](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/annotation/Html.html#anchorText())
- [format](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/annotation/Html.html#format())
- [link](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/annotation/Html.html#link())
- [noTableHeaders](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/annotation/Html.html#noTableHeaders())
- [noTables](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/annotation/Html.html#noTables())
- [render](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/annotation/Html.html#render())

The [@Html(link)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/annotation/Html.html#link) annotation adds a hyperlink to a bean property when rendered as HTML.
### Example:


```java
public class FileSpace {
    // Add a hyperlink to this bean property.
    @Html(link="servlet:/drive/{drive}")
    public String getDrive() {...}
}
```


The [@Html(anchorText)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/annotation/Html.html#anchorText) annotation is used to specify the anchor text of a hyperlink.
### Example:


```java
// Produces CLICK ME! when serialized to HTML.
public class FileSpace {
    // Add a hyperlink to this bean property.
    @Html(link="servlet:/drive/{drive}", anchorText="CLICK ME!")
    public String getDrive() {...}
}
```


The [@Html(format)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/annotation/Html.html#format) annotation is used to specify what format to use for HTML elements.
For example, the HTML beans defined in the [html5](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/dto/html5.html) package use `format=XML` so that
the beans get serialized as standard XML:
### Example:


```java
// Parent class of all HTML DTO beans.
@Html(format=XML)
public abstract class HtmlElement {...}
```


The [@Html(noTableHeaders)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/annotation/Html.html#noTableHeaders) annotation is used to prevent beans from being serialized with table headers.
The [@Html(noTables)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/annotation/Html.html#noTables) annotation is used to force beans to be serialized as trees instead of tables
