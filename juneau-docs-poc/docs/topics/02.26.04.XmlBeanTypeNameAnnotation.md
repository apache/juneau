title: "@Bean(typeName) Annotation"
---

The [@Bean(typeName)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html#typeName()) annotation can be used to override the Juneau default name on bean elements.

Types names serve two distinct purposes:
- To override the element name.
- To serve as a class identifier so that the correct sub type can be created during parsing.

The following examples show how type names can be used to override element names:

:::tip Example 1

```java
public class Person {
    public String name;
    public int age;
}

// Produces
// <person><name>John Smith</name><age>21</age></person>
String xml = XmlSerializer.DEFAULT.serialize(new Person());

```

:::tip Example 2

```java
@Bean(typeName="person")
public class Person {
    public String name;
    public int age;
}

// Produces
// <person><name>John Smith</name><age>21</age></person>
String xml = XmlSerializer.DEFAULT.serialize(new Person());

```

Type names are also used for resolving class types during parsing when the exact class type cannot be inferred through reflection.

:::note
When serializing to XML, the element name is determined in the following order of precedence:
1. The XML name (see [@Xml](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/xml/annotation/Xml.html) annotation).
2. The [@Bean(typeName)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html#typeName()) value.
3. The class name.
