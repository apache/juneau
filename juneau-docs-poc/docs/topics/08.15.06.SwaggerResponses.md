Under the input parameters are listed the possible responses for the resource:
The `200` response is determined by the return type on the method, in this case a collection of `Pet` objects:

```java
@RestGet(
    path="/pet",
    summary="All pets in the store",
    ...
)
public Collection getPets() throws NotAcceptable {
    return store.getPets();
}
```


Note that additional responses can be specified by throwing exceptions annotated with the [@Response](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Response.html) annotation such
as this one:

```java
@Response
@StatusCode(406)
@Schema(description="Not Acceptable")
public class NotAcceptable extends BasicHttpException {...}
```


Like input parameters, the Swagger for responses can be define in multiple locations such as:
- [@Response](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Response.html) annotated classes, methods, and parameters.
- [@Rest(swagger)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html#swagger()) / [@RestOp(swagger)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestOp.html#swagger()) annotations.
