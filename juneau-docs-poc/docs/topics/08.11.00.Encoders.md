title: "Encoders"
---

The [@Rest(encoders)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html#encoders) annotation can be used to associate character encoders with a servlet class.
Encoders can be used to enable various kinds of compression (e.g.
"gzip") on requests and responses based on the request Accept-Encoding and Content-Encoding headers.
:::tip Example


```java
// Servlet with automated support for GZIP compression
@Rest(encoders={GzipEncoder.class})
public MyRestServlet extends BasicRestServlet {
    ...
}
```


Juneau defines the following encoders out-of-the-box:
-
[GzipEncoder](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/encoders/GzipEncoder.html)
-
[IdentityEncoder](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/encoders/IdentityEncoder.html)
