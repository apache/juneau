### Contents/Features

The [http]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/http.html) package contains a slew of useful extensions to the Apache HttpComponents libraries and define APIs used extensively in the REST server and client APIs.

These APIs extend from the Apache HttpComponents libraries and can be used with libraries based on it such as Apache HttpClient.
The REST Client API described later is built on top of Apache HttpClient and many of the classes defined in this package make up integral components of that API.
Likewise, the APIs defined here are also used in the REST Server APIs also described later.
