These are built upon existing `HttpComponent` APIs:

<tree>
<node-0><java-interface>`org.apache.http.HttpMessage`</java-interface></node-0>
<node-1><java-interface>`org.apache.http.HttpResponse`</java-interface></node-1>
<node-2><java-class>[BasicHttpResponse]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/http/response/BasicHttpResponse.html)</java-class> - 100-399 response codes</node-2>
<node-2><java-class>[BasicHttpException]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/http/response/BasicHttpException.html)</java-class> - 400+ response codes</node-2>
</tree>

The most common location where these responses are used are in REST operation methods described later.

:::tip Example
```java
@RestDelete(path="/{id}")
public Ok doDelete(@Path int id) throws NotFound, Unauthorized {
    pojoService.delete(pojoService.find(id).orElseThrow(NotFound::new));
    return Ok.OK;
}
```

The following classes are also provided for constructing your own custom responses:

<tree>
<node-0><java-class>[BasicHttpException]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/http/response/BasicHttpException.html)</java-class></node-0>
<node-0><java-class>[BasicHttpResponse]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/http/response/BasicHttpResponse.html)</java-class></node-0>
</tree>
