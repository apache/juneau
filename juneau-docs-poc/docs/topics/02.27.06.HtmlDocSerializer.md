### Example:


```java
/**
* Sample REST resource that prints out a simple "Hello world!" message.

*/
@Rest(path="/helloWorld")
@HtmlDocConfig(
    navlinks={
        "up: request:/..",
        "options: servlet:/?method=OPTIONS"
    },
    aside={
        "",
        "	This page shows a resource that simply response with a 'Hello world!' message
```


",
"
The POJO serialized is a simple String.
",
""
\}
)
public class HelloWorldResource extends BasicRestServlet \{...\}
The [Builder#template(Class)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/HtmlDocSerializer/Builder.html#template(Class)) setting defines
a template for the HTML page being generated.
The default template is described next.
