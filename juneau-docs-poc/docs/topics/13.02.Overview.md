The Jetty Microservice API consists of a combination of the Juneau Core, Server, and Client APIs and an embedded
Eclipse Jetty Servlet Container.
The API builds upon the Core Microservices classes to produce easy-to-create and
easy-to-use microservices in a standard Java 1.8+ environment.
The `juneau-microservice-jetty` library consists of the following classes:
- [jetty](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/microservice/jetty.html)
- [JettyMicroservice](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/microservice/jetty/JettyMicroservice.html) - The Jetty microservice class.
- [Builder](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/microservice/jetty/JettyMicroservice/Builder.html) - Builder for the microservice class.
- [JettyMicroserviceListener](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/microservice/jetty/JettyMicroserviceListener.html) - Interface for hooking into lifecyle events of the microservice.
- [BasicJettyMicroserviceListener](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/microservice/jetty/BasicJettyMicroserviceListener.html) - Adapter for JettyMicroserviceListener class.
- [JettyServerFactory](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/microservice/jetty/JettyServerFactory.html) - Interface for defining custom Jetty servers.
- [BasicJettyServerFactory](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/microservice/jetty/BasicJettyServerFactory.html) - Adapter for JettyServerFactory class.

The most-basic creation of a Jetty microservice from an entry-point method is shown below:

```java
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JettyMicroservice
            .create()                     // Create builder.
            .args(args)                   // Pass in args.
            .servlets(RootResource.class) // A Juneau RestServlet class.
            .build()                      // Create microservice.
            .start()                      // Start microservice.
        ;
    }
}

```
