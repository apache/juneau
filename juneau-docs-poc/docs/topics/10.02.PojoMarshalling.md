By default, JSON support is provided for HTTP request and response bodies.
Other languages can be specified using any of the following builder methods:
- [Builder](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html)
- [json()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#json())
- [json5()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#json5())
- [xml()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#xml())
- [html()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#html())
- [plainText()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#plainText())
- [msgPack()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#msgPack())
- [uon()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#uon())
- [urlEnc()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#urlEnc())
- [openApi()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#openApi())

### Example:


```java
// Create a basic REST client with JSON 5 support.
// Typically easier to use when performing unit tests.
RestClient client = RestClient.create().json5().build();
```


Clients can also support multiple languages:
### Example:


```java
// Create a REST client with support for multiple languages.
RestClient client1 = RestClient.create().json().xml().openApi().build();

// Create a REST client with support for all supported languages.
RestClient client2 = RestClient.create().universal().build();
```


When using clients with multiple language support, the request language is selected by setting the `Content-Type`
request header.

```java
// Create a REST client with support for multiple languages.
RestClient client = RestClient.create().universal().build();

client.post(URI, myBean)
    .contentType("application/json")
    .complete()
    .assertStatus().asCode().is(200);
```


Languages can also be specified per-request.

```java
// Create a REST client with no default languages supported.
RestClient client = RestClient.create().build();

// Use JSON for this request.
client.post(URI, myBean)
    .json()
    .complete()
    .assertStatus().asCode().is(200);
```


The [Builder](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html) class provides convenience methods for setting common serializer and parser
settings.
### Example:


```java
// Create a basic REST client with JSON support.
// Use single-quotes and whitespace.
RestClient client1 = RestClient.create().json().sq().ws().build();
```


Other methods are also provided for specifying the serializers and parsers used for lower-level marshalling support:
- [Builder](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html)
- [serializer(Serializer)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#serializer(Serializer))
- [parser(Parser)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#parser(Parser))
- [marshaller(Marshaller)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#marshaller(Marshaller))

HTTP parts (headers, query parameters, form data...) are serialized and parsed using the [HttpPartSerializer](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/httppart/HttpPartSerializer.html)
and [HttpPartParser](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/httppart/HttpPartParser.html) APIs.  By default, clients are configured to use [OpenApiSerializer](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/oapi/OpenApiSerializer.html) and
[OpenApiParser](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/oapi/OpenApiParser.html).  These can be overridden using the following methods:
- [Builder](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html)
- [partSerializer(Class\&lt;? extends HttpPartSerializer\&gt;)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#partSerializer(Class))
- [partParser(Class\&lt;? extends HttpPartParser\&gt;)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#partParser(Class))
