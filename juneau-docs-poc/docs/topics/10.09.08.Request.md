title: "@Request"
---

The [@Request](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Request.html) annotation can be applied to a type of a @RemoteOp-annotated method to identify it as a bean for setting HTTP parts through a bean-like interface.
- [Request](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Request.html)
- [serializer](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Request.html#serializer()) - Override the part serializer.

:::tip Example


```java
@Remote(path="/petstore")
public interface PetStore {

    @RemotePost
    String postPet(CreatePetRequest bean);
}
```


```java
@Request
public class CreatePetRequest {

    private CreatePet pet;

    public CreatePetRequest(String name, float price) {
        this.pet = new CreatePet(name, price);
    }

    @Content
    public CreatePet getContent() {
        return this.pet;
    }

    @Query
    public Map getQueryParams() {
        return AMap.of("debug", true);
    }

    @Header("E-Tag")
    public static UUID getUUID() {
        return UUID.generatedUUID();
    }
}
```


```java
PetStore store = client.getRemote(PetStore.class, "http://localhost:10000");

CreatePetRequest requestBean = new CreatePetRequest("Fluffy", 9.99);
String response = store.postPet(requestBean);
```


The @Request annotation can be applied to either the class or argument.
The annotated methods must be no-arg and public.
They can be named anything.
Any of the following annotations can be used on the methods:
- [Content](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Content.html)
- [Header](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Header.html)
- [FormData](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/FormData.html)
- [Query](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Query.html)
- [Path](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Path.html)

The behavior and functionality of all of the annotations are the same as if they were used on method arguments directly.
This means full support for OpenAPI serialization and validation.
Annotations on methods are inherited from parent classes and interfaces.
For example, the request bean above could have defined annotations in an interface to keep them clear from the implementation:

```java
@Request
public interface CreatePetRequest {

    @Content
    CreatePet getContent();

    @Query
    Map getQueryParams();

    @Header("E-Tag")
    UUID getUUID();
}
```


```java
public class CreatePetRequestImpl implements CreatePetRequest {

    public CreatePetRequestImpl(String name, float price) {...}

    @Override
    public CreatePet getContent() {
        return this.pet;
    }

    @Override
    public Map getQueryParams() {
        return JsonMap.of("debug", true);
    }

    @Override
    public UUID getUUID() {
        return UUID.generateUUID();
    }
}

```
