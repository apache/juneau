title: "Microservice Overview"
---

The Microservice API consists of a base class for defining executable microservices.
Features include: - A builder-based API for defining and starting microservices.
- An extensible API that allows you to hook into various lifecycle events.
- Simple-to-use APIs for accessing manifest file entries, command-line arguments, and external configuration file properties.
The Microservice API consists of the following packages and classes:
- [microservice]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/microservice.html)
- [Microservice]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice.html) - The base microservice class.
- [Builder]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice/Builder.html) - Builder for the microservice class.
- [MicroserviceListener]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/microservice/MicroserviceListener.html) - Interface for hooking into lifecyle events of the microservice.
- [BasicMicroserviceListener]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/microservice/BasicMicroserviceListener.html) - Adapter for MicroserviceListener class.
- [console]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/microservice/console.html)
- [ConsoleCommand]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/microservice/console/ConsoleCommand.html) - Abstract class for defining console commands.

By itself the Microservice API doesn't provided much functionality but it does provide the basis for the Jetty Microservice described later.
The most-basic creation of a microservice from an entry-point method is shown below:

```java
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Microservice
            .create()   // Create builder.
            .args(args) // Pass in args.
            .build()    // Create microservice.
            .start()    // Start microservice.
        ;
    }
}

```
