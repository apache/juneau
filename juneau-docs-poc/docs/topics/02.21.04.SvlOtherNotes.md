- The escape character '\' can be used when necessary to escape the following characters: `$ , \{ \}` - **WARNING:**  It is possible to cause [StackOverflowErrors](../apidocs/java/lang/StackOverflowError.html) if your nested variables result in a recursive loop (e.g.
the environment variable `'MYPROPERTY'` has the value `'$E\{MYPROPERTY\}'`).
So don't do that!
- As a general rule, this class tries to be as efficient as possible by not creating new strings when not needed.
For example, calling the resolve method on a string that doesn't contain variables (e.g.
`resolver.resolve("foobar")`) will simply be a no-op and return the same string.
