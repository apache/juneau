title: "Response Processors"
---

The REST Server API uses the concept of registered response processors for converting objects returned by REST methods or set through [RestResponse#setContent(Object)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/RestResponse.html#setContent(Object)) into appropriate HTTP responses.
By default, REST resource classes are registered with the following response processors:
- [HttpEntityProcessor](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/processor/HttpEntityProcessor.html)
- [HttpResourceProcessor](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/processor/HttpResourceProcessor.html)
- [HttpResponseProcessor](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/processor/HttpResponseProcessor.html)
- [InputStreamProcessor](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/processor/InputStreamProcessor.html)
- [PlainTextPojoProcessor](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/processor/PlainTextPojoProcessor.html)
- [ReaderProcessor](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/processor/ReaderProcessor.html)
- [ResponseBeanProcessor](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/processor/ResponseBeanProcessor.html)
- [SerializedPojoProcessor](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/processor/SerializedPojoProcessor.html)
- [ThrowableProcessor](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/processor/ThrowableProcessor.html)

Custom response processors can be associated with REST resources via the following:
- [Rest#responseProcessors](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html#responseProcessors)
- [Builder#responseProcessors()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/RestContext/Builder.html#responseProcessors())

Response processors can be used to process POJOs that cannot normally be handled through Juneau serializers, or because it's simply easier to define response processors for special cases.
The following example shows how to create a response processor to handle special `Foo` objects outside the normal Juneau architecture.

```java
