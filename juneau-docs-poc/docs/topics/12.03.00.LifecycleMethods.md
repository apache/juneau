title: "Lifecycle Methods"
---

The lifecycle methods of the [Microservice](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice.html) class
consists of the following:

<tree>
<node-0><java-class>[Microservice](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice.html)</java-class></node-0>
<node-1><javac-method>[start()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice.html#start())</javac-method> <javac-method>[startConsole()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice.html#startConsole())</javac-method> <javac-method>[join()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice.html#join())</javac-method> <javac-method>[stop()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice.html#stop())</javac-method> <javac-method>[stopConsole()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice.html#stopConsole())</javac-method> <javac-method>[exit()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice.html#exit())</javac-method> <javac-method>[kill()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice.html#kill())</javac-method></node-1>
</tree>

A typical implementation of an app with lifecycle methods might look like the following:

```java
public class App {

    private static final Microservice MICROSERVICE;

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MICROSERVICE = Microservice
            .create()          // Create builder.
            .args(args)        // Pass in args.
            .build()           // Create microservice.
            .start()           // Start microservice.
            .startConsole()    // Start console.
            .join()            // Join thread.
        ;
    }

    public static void restart() {
        MICROSERVICE.stop().start();
    }

    public static void exit() {
        MICROSERVICE.exit();
    }
}
```

If your application consists of a single microservice, you can use the [Microservice.getInstance()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice.html#getInstance()) method from anywhere in your code:

```java
public class App {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Microservice
            .create()          // Create builder.
            .args(args)        // Pass in args.
            .build()           // Create microservice.
            .start()           // Start microservice.
            .startConsole()    // Start console.
            .join()            // Join thread.
        ;
    }

    public static void restart() {
        Microservice.getInstance().stop().start();
    }

    public static void exit() {
        Microservice.getInstance().exit();
    }
}
```

The [Microservice.startConsole()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice.html#startConsole()) and [Microservice.stopConsole()](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice.html#stopConsole()) control the lifecycle of the console commands.
Typically you'll want to control these separately from the app so that you can easily restart your application from the
console without affecting the console itself.

The lifecycle methods on the [Microservice](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/microservice/Microservice.html) class are
purposely left non-final so that subclasses can override them to provide customized behavior.
