# Release 5.0.0.2

**Date:** Sept 28, 2012

Juno 5.0.0.2 is a minor update.

- Improvements to Javadocs. Most of the information in the Juno Starters Guide wiki has been moved into the overview and package-level javadocs. Since the information is now written in HTML, you can now copy and paste the code examples directly from the Javadocs. The code examples are also syntax-highlighted using CSS.

- Support for defining default XML namespaces on packages and classes for the XML and RDF serializers.

- Restructured the packages along content type support (e.g. all JSON support moved to `org.apache.juneau.json`).

- Automatic support for parsing maps with `Enum` keys, and parsing `Enum` strings. This was previously possible using filters but now it's built-in for all the parsers.

- Replaced the `ObjectList.toXArray()` methods with a new `elements(Class<T> type)` method that's more efficient and avoids creating an unnecessary array.

- Support for parsing into beans with read-only properties. New ~~@BeanConstructor~~ annotation allows you to specify bean property values to be passed in through a constructor.

- Separated the rest library into separate independent client and server libraries. Use one, use both, it's up to you.
