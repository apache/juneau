# Release 5.0.0.2

**Date:** Sept 28, 2012

Juno 5.0.0.2 is a minor update.

- Improvements to Javadocs. Most of the information in the Juno Starters Guide wiki has been moved into the overview and package-level javadocs. Since the information is now written in HTML, you can now copy and paste the code examples directly from the Javadocs. The code examples are also syntax-highlighted using CSS.
