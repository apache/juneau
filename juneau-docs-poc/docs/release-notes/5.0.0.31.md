# Release 5.0.0.31

**Date:** Aug 9, 2013

Juno 5.0.0.31 is a moderate update.

- Simplified the [Serializer]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/serializer/Serializer.html) and [Parser]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/parser/Parser.html) class hierarchies. This reverses a previous change that added a bunch of interfaces in these APIs (and subsequently required compiling with Java 7 to get around a compiler bug). The new class hierarchy is much simpler to understand.

- Added ~~XMLGregorianCalendarSwap~~ to convert these to ISO8601 strings during serialization, and vice versa during parsing.

- Added a strict mode to [JsonParser]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/json/JsonParser.html).

- Added default [JsonParser.DEFAULT_STRICT]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/json/JsonParser#DEFAULT_STRICT.html) parser.
