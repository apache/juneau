# Release 5.0.0.35

**Date:** Nov 26, 2013

Juno 5.0.0.35 is a minor update.
~~RestGuard.guard(RestRequest,RestResponse)~~now returns a boolean to allow redirects to login pages.
Fixed bug in RestServlet where occasional false positive "duplicate method with same name and path" errors were occurring.
