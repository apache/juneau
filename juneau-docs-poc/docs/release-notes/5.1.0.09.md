# Release 5.1.0.9

**Date:** Dec 1, 2014

Juno 5.1.0.9 is a major update.
There weren't very many code changes but the source has been made a part of Jazz Foundation.
This required some restructuring of the project.
The project on Jazz Hub will eventually be discontinued.
However, the libraries on IBM Community Source will continue to be updated regularly.
Project split up into 3 separate bundles:
`org.apache.juneau` - Core serializers and parsers.
`org.apache.juneau.rest` - REST server component.
`org.apache.juneau.rest.client` - REST client component.
Code changes to facilitate breaking up bundles:
`org.apache.juneau.rest.labels.Link` class moved to ~~Link~~.
References to `org.apache.juneau.rest.RestException` in \{@link oaj.encoders.Encoder\} class changed to `IOException`.
Changed configuration names for consistency with Jazz Framework.
~~RestClient.execute(HttpUriRequest)~~method that allows subclasses to handle their own HTTP request execution.
Changes in `JazzRestClient` to handle introduction of SSO support in v6.
`&plainText` debug feature was broken.
Removed double-buffering in `RestRequest`.
Metadata cleanup, Find Bug fixes.
