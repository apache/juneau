# Release 5.1.0.14

**Date:** May 10, 2015

Juno 5.1.0.14 is a moderate update.

The major addition is support for **Remoteable Services**, the ability to invoke server-side POJO methods through
client-side proxy interfaces.

#### Core

- Simplified ~~PojoIntrospector~~ class.

- New ~~ClassUtils.getMethodSignature(Method)~~ method.

#### Client

- New methods in [RestClient]({{API_DOCS}}/oajrc/RestClient.html) for working with remoteable services:
  - ~~RestClient.setRemoteableServletUri(String)~~
  - ~~RestClient.getRemoteableProxy(Class)~~

#### Server

- Added a default OPTIONS page to ~~BasicRestServlet~~ and ~~RestServletJenaDefault~~.

- `RestServletProperties.REST_allowMethodParam` has been enhanced to allow you to explicitly specify which HTTP methods can be used in the `&method` parameter.

- New methods added to [RestRequest]({{API_DOCS}}/oajr/RestRequest.html):
  - ~~RestRequest.getParser()~~
  - ~~RestRequest.getReaderParser()~~
