# Release 8.2.0

**Date:** Oct 14, 2020

Juneau 8.2.0 is a major release. 

The most significant change is the addition of an entirely new ~~RestClient~~ API build from scratch with near 100% unit
test coverage.

The new API is located in the `org.apache.juneau.rest.client2` package and will replace the old API in 9.0.

#### juneau-marshall

[@Bean]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html) and [@BeanIgnore]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/annotation/BeanIgnore.html) annotations can alternately occur in parent class hierarchy.

The first one found dictates whether a class is ignored as a bean or not.

Applying the [@Bean]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html) annotation on a class will now force
non-public classes to be interpreted as beans.

For example, applying [@Bean]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html) to a private class will force it to
be treated as a bean.

Also, if a public bean constructor cannot be found, the default constructor will be used regardless of it's visibility
if the [@Bean]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html) annotation is on the class.

The @Beanc annotation can now be recognized and used on non-public constructors.

Annotations are now aggregated across the entire class hierarchy instead of simply being overridden.

The following is an example.

```text
// Parent class with properties a,b,c
@Bean(bpi="a,b,c")
public class MyClass {
public int a, b, c, d;
}
// New behavior:  Child class with properties a,c because @Beans are aggregated.
// Old behavior:  Child class with properties a,c,d because @Bean is overridden.
@Bean(bpx="b")
public class MyClass {
public int a, b, c, d;
}
```

Include/exclude/read-only/write-only properties defined on the bean context now override those defined on 
annotations of the class itself.
For example, the following methods override the [@Bean]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html)
annotations on classes:

<tree>
<node-0><java-class>[Builder]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/BeanContext/Builder.html)</java-class></node-0>
<node-1><java-method>~~Builder.bpi(Class,String) bpi(Class,String)~~</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>~~Builder.bpi(String,String) bpi(String,String)~~</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>~~Builder.bpx(Class,String) bpx(Class,String)~~</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>~~Builder.bpx(String,String) bpx(String,String)~~</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>~~Builder.bpro(Class,String) bpro(Class,String)~~</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>~~Builder.bpro(String,String) bpro(String,String)~~</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>~~Builder.bpwo(Class,String) bpwo(Class,String)~~</java-method></node-1>
<node-1><java-method>~~Builder.bpwo(String,String) bpwo(String,String)~~</java-method></node-1>
</tree>

Config annotations now override class-level annotations.
For example, only the 'a' and 'b' properties get serialized on the bean below:

```text
// Parent class with properties a,b,c
@Bean(bpi="a,b,c")
public class MyClass {
public int a, b, c, d;
}
@RestMethod
@BeanConfig(beanApply={@Bean(on="MyClass",bpi="a,b")}
public MyClass getMyClass() {...}
```

The following concrete annotation implementation classes are now provided that can be used with the [annotations()]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/BeanContext/Builder.html#annotations(Annotation...)) method:

Example:

```text
@Bean(bpi="street,city") // Will be overridden
public class AddressBean {...}
Bean ba = new BeanAnnotation("AddressBean").bpi("street,city,state");
WriterSerializer ws = JsonSerializer.create().annotations(ba).build();
String json = ws.toString(addressBean);  // Will print street,city,state
```

Bean maps now have the concept of "hidden" properties (properties that aren't serialized but otherwise accessible).
For example, the [link()]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/html/annotation/Html.html#link()) can now reference hidden
properties:

```text
@Bean(bpi="a") // Will be overridden
public class MyBean {
@Html(link="servlet:/{b}")
public String a;
public String b;  // Not serialized but referenced in link on a.  
}
```

The general rule for the [BeanMap]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/BeanMap.html) class is that `get()`,`put()`, and
`containsKey()`
will work against hidden properties but `keySet()` and `entrySet()` will skip them.
Several bug fixes in the [HtmlSerializer]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/html/HtmlSerializer.html) and [HtmlParser]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/html/HtmlParser.html) classes around the handling of 
collections and arrays of beans with `@Bean(typeName)` annotations.
New swaps auto-added to all serializers/parsers:
~~MatchResultSwap~~ 
~~StackTraceElementSwap~~
[noTableHeaders()]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/html/annotation/Html.html#noTableHeaders) now can be applied to
collections of beans.
New [asideFloat()]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/html/annotation/HtmlDocConfig.html#asideFloat()) setting so that you
can position the contents of the aside section on the page.
Various minor fixes surrounding HTML serialization.
Collections of beans that were supposed to be serialized as tables were being serialized as lists.
Collections of beans with `@Bean(bpi)` were not being serialized in the correct column order.			
Fixed a bug where a copy constructor can erroneously be recognized as a builder constructor if the class also
has a static `create` method.
Net effect was that the copy constructor would needlessly be called during parsing.
New [collections]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/collections.html) package containing various convenience fluent-style
collection classes:
~~AList~~
~~ASet~~
~~ASortedSet~~
~~AMap~~
~~ASortedMap~~
~~OMap~~
~~OList~~
~~ObjectMap~~ is being deprecated and replaced with ~~OMap~~.
~~ObjectList~~ is being deprecated and replaced with ~~OList~~.
All classes in the [response]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/http/response.html) and ~~exception~~ now have
`header(String,Object)`
methods for adding response headers.

```text
// Method that performs a BASIC Auth handshake.
@RestMethod
public Ok checkBasicAuth(@Header("Authorization") String auth) throws Unauthorized {
if (auth == null) 
throw new Unauthorized().header("WWW-Authenticate", "BASIC realm=\"foo\"");
return Ok.OK;
}
```		

New annotations for multi-part support:
~~Header.multi()~~
~~Query.multi()~~
~~FormData.multi()~~
~~BeanTraverseContext.BEANTRAVERSE_ignoreRecursions~~setting no longer requires ~~BeanTraverseContext.BEANTRAVERSE_detectRecursions~~
to be enabled.
Fixed bug in JSON/UON/URL-Encoding serializers where indentation was not correct of first line when ~~BeanTraverseContext.BEANTRAVERSE_initialDepth~~
used.
Fixed bug in JSON/UON/URL-Encoding serializers where properties past the max depth were being serialized as null instead
of being treated as null and not being serialized at all.
Fixed bug in HTML serializer where tables of maps were not sorted if SERIALIZER_sortMaps was specified.
SERIALIZER_trimNullProperties has been replaced with ~~Serializer.SERIALIZER_keepNullProperties
SERIALIZER_keepNullProperties~~.
Improvements to OpenAPI serializer and parser:
Collection format can now be specified on OBJECTs to allow key/value pairs to be delimited with the same support as
ARRAYs.
New ~~OpenApiCommon.OAPI_format OAPI_format~~and ~~OpenApiCommon.OAPI_collectionFormat
OAPI_collectionFormat~~properties.
Convenience methods added to [HttpPartSchema]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/httppart/HttpPartSchema.html) and related
classes to simplify schema definitions:

```text
import static org.apache.juneau.httppart.HttpPartSchema.*;
// Old
HttpPartSchema s = schema("object")
.property("f01", schema("array").collectionFormat("pipes").items(schema("string")))
.property("f02", schema("array").collectionFormat("pipes").items(schema("string", "byte")))
.property("f03", schema("array").collectionFormat("pipes").items(schema("string", "date-time")))
.build();
// New
HttpPartSchema s = tObject()
.p("f01", tArray(tString()))
.p("f02", tArray(tByte()))
.p("f03", tArray(tDateTime()))
.build();
```

Fixes where the bean method/constructor visibility wasn't being used when finding swap methods and constructors.
HTML-Schema support is being deprecated due to low-use and difficulty in maintaining.
It will be removed in 9.0.
`JuneauLogger` class is being deprecated.
Improvements in logging in Java 8 make it obsolete.
Bean filters can now be specified programmatically through a builder API.

```text
// Create a JSON serializer that only includes specified fields on a specific class.
WriterSerializer s = JsonSerializer
.create()
.beanFilters(BeanFilter.create(MyBean.class).bpi("foo,bar,baz").build())
.build();
```

`BeanContext.REST_pojoSwaps` replaced with ~~BeanContext.BEAN_swaps~~(and builder methods as well).
New Bean Property Interceptor API for intercepting calls to bean getters/setters.
~~BeanInterceptor~~
[Bean(interceptor)]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html#interceptor)
[beanInterceptor()]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/BeanContext/Builder.html#beanInterceptor(Class,Class))
Fluent setters that follow the `withX` convention are now automatically detected by all parsers.

```text
// A bean with a fluent setter.
public class MyBean {
public MyBean withFoo(String foo) {
this.foo = foo;
return this;
}
}
```

Note you could previously use the @BeanProperty annotation to identify these setters.

#### juneau-rest-server

New ~~RestContext.REST_context REST_context~~/~~Rest.context() @Rest(context)~~ setting to allow you to extend the [RestContext]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/RestContext.html)
class.
[Rest]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html)-annotated classes can now implement the following
interfaces directly instead of having
to define secondary classes and hook them up through annotations:
~~RestCallHandler~~- Normally defined through ~~ oajr.annotation.Rest.callHandler() @Rest.callHandler()~~.
~~RestInfoProvider~~ - Normally defined through ~~ oajr.annotation.Rest.infoProvider() @Rest.infoProvider()~~.
~~RestCallLogger~~- Normally defined through ~~ oajr.annotation.Rest.callLogger() @Rest.callLogger()~~.
~~ClasspathResourceFinder~~ - Normally defined through ~~ oajr.annotation.Rest.classpathResourceFinder()
@Rest.classpathResourceFinder()~~.
The methods added for ~~RestInfoProvider~~ are:
~~RestServlet~~
~~getSwagger(RestRequest)~~
~~getSiteName(RestRequest)~~
~~getTitle(RestRequest)~~
~~getDescription(RestRequest)~~
~~getMethodSummary(Method,RestRequest)~~
~~getMethodDescription(Method,RestRequest)~~
~~BasicRest~~
~~getSwagger(RestRequest)~~
~~getSiteName(RestRequest)~~
~~getTitle(RestRequest)~~
~~getDescription(RestRequest)~~
~~getMethodSummary(Method,RestRequest)~~
~~getMethodDescription(Method,RestRequest)~~
The methods added for ~~RestCallLogger~~are:
~~RestServlet~~
~~RestServlet.log(RestCallLoggerConfig,HttpServletRequest,HttpServletResponse) log(RestCallLoggerConfig,HttpServletRequest,HttpServletResponse)~~
~~BasicRest~~
~~BasicRest.log(RestCallLoggerConfig,HttpServletRequest,HttpServletResponse) log(RestCallLoggerConfig,HttpServletRequest,HttpServletResponse)~~
The methods added for ~~ClasspathResourceFinder~~are:
~~RestServlet~~
~~RestServlet.findResource(Class,String,Locale) findResource(Class,String,Locale)~~
~~BasicRest~~
~~BasicRest.findResource(Class,String,Locale) findResource(Class,String,Locale)~~
The methods added for ~~RestResourceResolver~~are:
~~RestServlet~~
~~ oajr.RestServlet.resolve(Object,Class,RestContext.Builder,Object...) resolve(Object,Class,RestContext.Builder,Object...)~~
~~BasicRest~~
~~ oajr.BasicRest.resolve(Object,Class,RestContext.Builder,Object...) resolve(Object,Class,RestContext.Builder,Object...)~~
Added the following convenience hook methods on the ~~RestServlet~~ and ~~BasicRest~~classes:
~~RestServlet~~
~~ oajr.RestServlet.onInit(RestContext.Builder) onInit(RestContext.Builder)~~
~~RestServlet.onPostInit(RestContext) onPostInit(RestContext)~~
~~RestServlet.onPostInitChildFirst(RestContext) onPostInitChildFirst(RestContext)~~
~~RestServlet.onDestroy(RestContext) onDestroy(RestContext)~~
~~RestServlet.onStartCall(HttpServletRequest,HttpServletResponse) onStartCall(HttpServletRequest,HttpServletResponse)~~
~~RestServlet.onPreCall(RestRequest,RestResponse) onPreCall(RestRequest,RestResponse)~~
~~RestServlet.onPostCall(RestRequest,RestResponse) onPostCall(RestRequest,RestResponse)~~
~~RestServlet.onEndCall(HttpServletRequest,HttpServletResponse) onEndCall(HttpServletRequest,HttpServletResponse)~~
~~BasicRest~~
~~ oajr.BasicRest.onInit(RestContext.Builder) onInit(RestContext.Builder)~~
~~BasicRest.onPostInit(RestContext) onPostInit(RestContext)~~
~~BasicRest.onPostInitChildFirst(RestContext) onPostInitChildFirst(RestContext)~~
~~BasicRest.onDestroy(RestContext) onDestroy(RestContext)~~
~~BasicRest.onStartCall(HttpServletRequest,HttpServletResponse) onStartCall(HttpServletRequest,HttpServletResponse)~~
~~BasicRest.onPreCall(RestRequest,RestResponse) onPreCall(RestRequest,RestResponse)~~
~~BasicRest.onPostCall(RestRequest,RestResponse) onPostCall(RestRequest,RestResponse)~~
~~BasicRest.onEndCall(HttpServletRequest,HttpServletResponse) onEndCall(HttpServletRequest,HttpServletResponse)~~
New [@Rest(debugOn)]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html#debugOn()) annotation for turning on debug
mode using class/method identifiers:

#### Example:

```text
// Turn on debug per-request on the class and always on the doX() method.
@Rest(
debugOn="MyResource=per-request,Mysource.doX=true"  // Typically defined via system or env property.
)
public class MyResource {
@RestMethod
public void String doX() {
...
}
```

~~BasicRestConfig~~ has been broken up into ~~BasicRestConfig~~ and ~~BasicRestMethods~~ so that
you're not forced to implement methods such as `getOptions()` and `getStats()` if you're implementing the interface
to configure your REST class.
Any of the following classes can now be instantiated with `public static create()` methods:
~~RestCallHandler~~
~~RestCallLogger~~
~~RestInfoProvider~~
~~ClasspathResourceFinder~~
~~RestResourceResolver~~
~~RestGuard~~
~~ResponseHandler~~
New ~~Path.required() @Path(required)~~annotation support.
A path can be marked as not-required when the path variable is resolved by a parent resource like so:

```text
@Rest(path="/parent/{p1}",children=Child.class)
public class Parent {
...
}
@Rest(path="/child")
public class Child {
@RestMethod(path="/")
public String doGet(@Path(name="p1",required=false) String p1) {
// p1 will be null when accessed via "/child"
// p1 will be non-null when accessed via "/parent/p1/child".
}
...
}
```

This allows the child resource to be mapped to multiple parents that may resolve various different path variables.
New ~~RestMethod.paths() @RestMethod(paths)~~ annotation that allows you to map multiple
paths to the same Java method.
Example:

```text
@RestMethod(
name=GET,
paths={"/","/{foo}"}
)
public String doGet(@Path(name="foo",required=false) String foo) {...}
```

The ~~RestMethod @RestMethod~~annotation is now implied on all unannotated methods of a [@Rest]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html)-annotated
interface.

```text
@Rest
public interface MyRest {
String getFoo();  // @RestMethod(name=GET,path="/foo") is implied.
}
```

Improved ~~RestContext.REST_messages REST_messages~~ support (mostly bug fixes).

#### juneau-rest-server-springboot

~~JuneauRestInitializer~~now provides a no-arg constructor so that it can be used in
the `@ConfigurationContext(initializers=JuneauRestInitializer.class)` when unit testing
using @SpringBootTest.
New ~~ResourceDescription.ResourceDescription(String,String,String)~~constructor and ~~ResourceDescriptions.append(String,String,String)~~ method.
New ~~Hyperlink~~class.

#### juneau-rest-client

Completely revamped RestClient API.
All APIs now extend from HttpClient interfaces.
Better integration with HttpClient.
New fluent-style methods with many new convenience methods.
Updated juneau-rest-client.
@RemoteMethod-annotated methods can now return [Futures]({{API_DOCS}}/java/util/concurrent/Future.html) and 
[CompletableFutures]({{API_DOCS}}/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html) for concurrent processing of requests.
Example:

```text
@Remote
public interface MyInterface {
public Future doGet();
}
MyInterface i = client.getRemote(MyInterface.class, "http://localhost:12345/myInterface");
Future f = i.doGet();
// Do other stuff.
String result = f.get();	
```

Additions to [Remote]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/Remote.html) annotation:
[version]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/Remote.html#version) - Adds a client version header to all
requests.
[headers]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/Remote.html#headers) - Adds a set of headers to all requests.
~~headerSupplier~~ - Adds a dynamic supplier of headers to all requests.

#### juneau-rest-mock

The `MockRest` and `MockRemote` classes have been remove entirely and all existing functions
have been moved into the improved ~~MockRestClient~~ class.
All REST test mocking can be
done through this single class.
