# Release 5.1.0.18

**Date:** Aug 5, 2015

Juno 5.1.0.18 is a minor update affecting the server component only.

#### Server

Fixed bug where localized strings weren't resolving when using chained resource bundles.
Servlet and method labels and descriptions can now contain embedded string variables.
New ~~RestMethod.input()~~and ~~RestMethod.responses()~~
annotations.
These replace the various `description` annotations added 2 days ago with a simpler design.
New methods on ~~RestServlet~~:
~~RestServlet.getMethodDescription(String,RestRequest)~~so that subclasses
can override the method description in the OPTIONS page.
~~RestServlet.createRequestVarResolver(RestRequest)~~so that subclasses
can override and augment the variable resolver.
~~RestServlet.resolveChild(Class)~~and ~~RestServlet.replaceChild(RestServlet)~~
classes that allows customized resolution of servlet instances (e.g. if services are defined in OSGi).
Reverted the ~~MethodDescription~~back to 5.1.0.16 since it was being used by someone.
