# Release 5.1.0.5

**Date:** Sept 1, 2014

Juno 5.1.0.5 is a moderate update.

- New ~~Redirect~~ class that simplifies performing redirections in REST methods.

- New pluggable  ~~ResponseHandler~~ class and ~~@RestResource(responseHandlers)~~ annotation for defining customer response handlers for special kinds of POJOs.

- New method ~~UrlEncodingSerializer.serializeUrlPart(Object)~~ method.

- New method ~~RestRequest.getServletURIBuilder()~~ for construcing servlet-based URLs more efficiently.

- New method [RestResponse.getNegotiatedOutputStream()]({{API_DOCS}}/oajr/RestResponse.html#getNegotiatedOutputStream()) that uses encoders if a match is found, and [RestResponse.getOutputStream()]({{API_DOCS}}/oajr/RestResponse.html#getOutputStream()) that just return the underlying output stream without any modifications.

- Fixed bug where some properties were not being propagated correctly when using ~~CoreObject.setProperties(ObjectMap)~~ on serializer and parser subclasses.

- Fixed bug in [HtmlSerializer]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/html/HtmlSerializer.html) where URL keys in Maps were not being serialized as hyperlinks.

- Fixed bug in [JsonSerializer]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/json/JsonSerializer.html) where `"_class"` and `"items"` attributes were not quoted in strict mode when using SERIALIZER_addClassAttrs feature.

- Fixed bug where `Content-Encoding` and `Character-Encoding` headers were being set when calling [RestResponse.getOutputStream()]({{API_DOCS}}/oajr/RestResponse.html#getOutputStream()).
  These should not be set if interacting with the output streams at a low level.

- Eliminated various convenience `RestResponse.sendRedirect(...)` methods due to the introduction of the  ~~Redirect~~ class.
