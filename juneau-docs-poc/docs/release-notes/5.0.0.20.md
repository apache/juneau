# Release 5.0.0.20

**Date:** Apr 7, 2013

Juno 5.0.0.20 is a major update.

#### Core API changes

- New Jena-based ~~RdfSerializer~~ for serializing POJOs to RDF/XML, RDF/XML-ABBREV, N-Triple, Turtle, and N3. Serializes ANY POJOs to RDF, even simple objects and primitives.

- New Jena-based ~~RdfParser~~ for parsing RDF/XML, RDF/XML-ABBREV, N3, Turtle, and N-Triple back into POJOs.

- ~~XmlSerializerContext.XML_autoDetectNamespaces~~default changed to <jk>true</jk>. The old default value would cause XML with unmapped namespaces if you didn't manually specify them via the ~~XmlSerializerContext.XML_namespaces~~ annotation. While setting the default to <jk>true</jk> is somewhat slower (since the serializer must crawl the POJO tree to find namespaces), the benefits of having it work out-of-the-box outweighs the performance concerns. For developers concerned about performance, they can always change it back to false and specify the namespaces themselves.

- Allow inheritance of ~~@RestResource~~ annotation. Serializers, parsers, filters, properties , guards, and converters definitions are automatically inherited from parent classes and interfaces.

- New `RestCall.setDateHeader(String,Object)` method for setting ISO8601 datetime headers.
