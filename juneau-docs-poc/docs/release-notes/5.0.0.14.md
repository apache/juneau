# Release 5.0.0.14

**Date:** Mar 23, 2013

Juno 5.0.0.14 is a major update.
The biggest change is that the `RestSerializer`, `RestParser`, `RestSerializerGroup`, and `RestParserGroup` classes have been eliminated entirely.
Instead, the existing \{@link oaj.serializer.Serializer\}, \{@link oaj.parser.Parser\}, ~~SerializerGroup~~, and ~~ParserGroup~~ classes of the core API have been augmented to replace them.
Adoptions will be required if you have previously used these classes.
###### Core API changes

New `org.apache.juneau.serializer` package.
- Entirely reworked class hierarchy to make it easier to define new serializers.
- New \{@link oaj.serializer.WriterSerializer\} base class for defining character-based serializers.
- New \{@link oaj.serializer.OutputStreamSerializer\} base class for defining byte-based serializers.
- Updated ~~SerializerGroup~~ class with full support for RFC2616 `Accept-Content` headers.
- Improved cloning support on serializers and serializer groups.

New `org.apache.juneau.parser` package.
- Entirely reworked class hierarchy to make it easier to define new parsers.
- New \{@link oaj.parser.ReaderParser\} base class for defining character-based parsers.
- New \{@link oaj.parser.InputStreamParser\} base class for defining byte-based parsers.
- Improved cloning support on parsers and parser groups.

New `org.apache.juneau.swap` package.
- Cleaner class structure.
- Improved ~~BeanFilter~~ class for defining property filters on beans.
- Improved ~~PojoQuery~~ class for defining filters on objects (previously called `ObjectFilter`).

New `org.apache.juneau.encoders` package.
- Defines API for \{@link oaj.encoders.Encoder Encoders\} for enabling compression in REST servlets and clients.
- Previously, gzip compression was enabled by default.  This new API allows you to plug in your own compression algorithms.
- New \{@link oaj.encoders.GzipEncoder\} class for enabling gzip compression.
- New ~~EncoderGroup~~ class for managing multiple encoders and finding them based on RFC2616 `Accept-Encoding` header values.

New `org.apache.juneau.plaintext` package.
- New \{@link oaj.plaintext.PlainTextSerializer\} and \{@link oaj.plaintext.PlainTextParser\} classes for serializing/parsing text/plain content.

New `org.apache.juneau.jso` package.
- New ~~JsoSerializer~~ class for serializing `application/x-java-serialized-object` content.

New `org.apache.juneau.soap` package.
- New \{@link oaj.soap.SoapXmlSerializer\} class for serializing `text/xml+soap` content.

Improved cloning support on the \{@link oaj.BeanContext\} class.
- Better caching.  Improved caching performance.

`JsonMap` and `JsonList` changed to ~~ObjectMap~~ and ~~ObjectList~~ to better reflect that they're not limited to just JSON support.
Renamed `PojoSwap` to ~~PojoQuery~~ to not confuse it with the new Filter API.
###### REST server API changes

Eliminated `org.apache.juneau.rest.serializers` and `org.apache.juneau.rest.parsers` packages.
- All existing REST serializers and parsers merged into the core API.

###### REST client API changes

Simplified \{@link oajrc.RestClient\} API.
- You can now only specify a single serializer or parser per client.  This significantly simplifies the code.
- Support for \{@link oaj.encoders.Encoder Encoders\}.

Eliminated `RestCmdLine` (since it's essentially redundant with CURL).
