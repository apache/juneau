# Release 5.0.0.3

**Date:** Oct 3, 2012

Juno 5.0.0.3 is a minor update.

- Support for parsing into read-only beans (i.e. beans with only getters, property values set through constructor args). To support this, the ~~@BeanConstructor~~ annotation has been added.

- Merged separate settings classes back into their base classes (simplifies the API).

- ~~SerializerGroups~~ and ~~ParserGroups~~ now share [BeanContexts]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/BeanContext.html) to reduce memory consumption of class type metadata.
