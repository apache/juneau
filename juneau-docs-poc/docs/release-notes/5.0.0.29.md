# Release 5.0.0.29

**Date:** Aug 2, 2013

Juno 5.0.0.29 is a moderate update.

- Revamped the API for filter support:
  - Updated  ~~BeanFilter~~ class to mirror the [@Bean]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html) annotation.
  - Introduced support for bean ~~Bean.subTypeProperty() subtypes~~.
  - Replaced `@Bean(filter=xxx)` with new ~~@Transform~~ annotation.

- Revamped URL-Encoding support.
  The old URL-Encoding serializer and parser simply used the JSON serializer/parser with a thin URL-encoding top layer.
  The new URL-Encoding serialize and parser was written from scratch and is considerably more consistent in design and
  output.

- Improved number parsing.
  The new number parser should handle any valid numeric syntax for decimals and floats that Java itself supports.

- [JsonSerializer]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/json/JsonSerializer.html) LAX mode now quotes reserved word attributes.

- New predefined DateFilters with millisecond precision:
  - `org.apache.juneau.swaps.DateSwap.ISO8601DTP`
  - `org.apache.juneau.swaps.DateSwap.ISO8601DTZP`
