# Release 5.0.0.18

**Date:** Mar 27, 2013

Juno 5.0.0.18 is a moderate update.
The biggest change is the introduction of the ~~RdfSerializer~~ class that uses Jena to generate RDF/XML, RDF/XML-ABBREV, N-Tuple, N3, and Turtle output.
This code should be considered prototype-quality, and subject to change in the future.
There are plans of adding an equivalent `RdfParser` class in the future, so the serializer logic may need to be tweaked to allow POJOs to be reconstituted correctly in the parser.
The `RdfXmlSerializer` class should be considered deprecated for now.
However, I'm keeping it around, since it's considerably faster and uses far less memory than the Jena-based serializer since it serializes directly from POJOs to RDF/XML.
It may or may not be removed in the future depending on demand.
#### Other changes

New ~~JsoParser~~ class.
