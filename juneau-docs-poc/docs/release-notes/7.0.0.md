# Release 7.0.0

**Date:** Oct 25, 2017

This release ups the Java prerequisite to Java 7.

### juneau-marshall

- New class  ~~HttpMethodName~~ with valid static string HTTP method names.

### juneau-dto

- Class `org.apache.juneau.dto.Link` renamed to [LinkString]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/dto/LinkString.html).
  Helps avoid confusion since there are other Link classes in the library.

### juneau-rest-server

- Annotation `@HtmlDoc(links)` renamed to ~~@HtmlDoc(navlinks)~~.

- New annotation ~~@HtmlDoc(head)~~.
  Allows you to specify arbitrary HTML content in the `<head>` section of the page.

- Removed annotation `@HtmlDoc(favIcon)`.
  This was a discouraged way of defining fav-icons anyway, and with the addition of `@HtmlDoc(head)`, you can define them using:

  ```java
  head={
      "<link rel='icon' href='$U{servlet:/htdocs/juneau.png}'/>"
  }
  ```

- Removed several of the HTMLDOC-related methods from the `RestResponse/RestConfig/RestContext` classes and moved it into the new  ~~HtmlDocBuilder~~ class.
