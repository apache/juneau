# Release 5.0.0.27

**Date:** July 7, 2013

Juno 5.0.0.27 is a moderate update.
Fixed some HTML formatting issues in \{@link oaj.html.HtmlSerializer\}.
~~BasicRestServlet~~ now includes \{@link oaj.plaintext.PlainTextSerializer\} and \{@link oaj.plaintext.PlainTextParser\} for plain-text support.
Child resources now render on default `OPTIONS` pages through new method ~~ResourceOptions.getChildren()~~.
Changes to \{@link oaj.urlencoding.UrlEncodingSerializer\}/\{@link oaj.urlencoding.UrlEncodingParser\} to reduce the need for quoted string values.
More changes are likely in this area of the code to support multipart form posts.
FindBugs fixes.
