# Release 5.1.0.1

**Date:** Jan 25, 2014

Juno 5.1.0.1 is a minor update.
Addressed some behavioral differences between Tomcat and WAS.  
Query parameter lookup is now always case-insensitive (per WAS behavior).
Consistent handling of redirect requests (Tomcat and WAS handle relative redirect paths differently).
Fixed bug involving incorrect resolution of overlapping URL match patterns.
Overall improvements in HTTP request parameter and header value resolution.  
Made workspace changes so as not to be dependent on the WAS test environment being loaded.
Renamed @Remainder annotation to ~~@PathRemainder~~.
Fixed bug involving incorrect calculation of `pathInfo` on child resources.
