# Release 8.1.2

**Date:** Dec 01, 2019

Juneau 8.1.2 is a moderate release.

#### juneau-marshall

Support for read-only and write-only properties.
~~Bean.bpro()~~
~~Bean.bpwo()~~
[ro()]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Beanp.html#ro())
[wo()]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Beanp.html#wo())
~~BEAN_bpro~~
~~BEAN_bpwo~~
~~Builder.bpro(Map)~~
~~Builder.bpwo(Map)~~
New convenience methods:
~~ObjectMap.parse(CharSequence)~~
~~ObjectList.parse(CharSequence)~~
~~CharMarshall~~and ~~StreamMarshall~~ now have public constructors.
[@Beanp]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Beanp.html) replaces ~~BeanProperty @BeanProperty~~.
[@Beanc]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Beanc.html) replaces ~~BeanConstructor @BeanConstructor~~.
[@Remote]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/Remote.html) replaces ~~RemoteResource @RemoteResource~~.
Shortened names for [@Bean(dictionary)]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/annotation/Bean.html#dictionary) and [beanDictionary()]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/BeanContext/Builder.html#beanDictionary(Class...)).

#### juneau-rest-server

[@Rest]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html) replaces ~~RestResource @RestResource~~ with shorter syntax.
New method ~~RestResponse.setHeaderSafe(String,String)~~to strip invalid characters from header values.
Fixed issues related to invalid characters being set on HTTP header values.

#### juneau-rest-client

[RestClient]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient.html) is now extendible.  The constructor has been made public and simplified to:
~~ oajrc.RestClient.RestClient(RestClient.Builder)~~.
Duplicate methods between [Builder]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html) and [HttpClientBuilder]({{API_DOCS}}/org/apache/http/impl/client/HttpClientBuilder.html)
have been made deprecated on the former.  This eliminates the need to try to keep the two builder classes in
sync.
