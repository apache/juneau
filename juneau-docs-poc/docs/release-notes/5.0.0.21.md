# Release 5.0.0.21

**Date:** Apr 9, 2013

Juno 5.0.0.21 is a minor update.
###### Core API changes

New ~~HtmlDocSerializerContext.HTMLDOC_navlinks~~ annotation for addint links to HTML page views.
Renamed the properties in ~~HtmlDocSerializerContext~~ for clarity.
###### Servlet API changes

Added new `RestServlet.addDefaultProperties(ObjectMap,RestRequest)` method for programatically adding properties to the property map per request.
Added the following new properties in the properties map to make them easily available to serializers and parsers (since they don't have access to the HTTP request object).
Note that the `SerializerContext.SERIALIZER_uriAuthority` and `SerializerContext.SERIALIZER_uriContext` properties were previously available.
- `RestServletProperties.REST_servletPath`
- `RestServletProperties.REST_pathInfo`
- `RestServletProperties.REST_method`

Path variables annotated with ~~@Attr~~are now automatically URL-decoded.
