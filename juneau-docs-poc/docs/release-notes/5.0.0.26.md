# Release 5.0.0.26

**Date:** Jun 5, 2013

Juno 5.0.0.26 is a minor update.

- FindBug fixes.

- Changed the way child REST resources are defined.
  Eliminated the [@RestChild](API_DOCS/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestChild.html) annotation on getter methods and replaced it with ~~@RestResource(children)~~ defined on the
  resource class itself.
  Child resource paths are specified through ~~@RestResource(path)~~.

- New ~~ChildResourceDescriptions~~ bean for automatically generating the contents of router resource pages.

- Changed `@RestMethod.pattern()` to ~~@RestMethod(path)~~ for naming consistency.
