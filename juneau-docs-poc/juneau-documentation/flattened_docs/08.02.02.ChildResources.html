{title:'Child Resources', updated:'9.0.0'}

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Child Resources are REST servlets or objects that are linked to parent resources through the 
		{@link oajr.annotation.Rest#children() @Rest(children)} annotation.
	</p>
	<h5 class='figure'>Example:</h5>
	<p class='bjava'>
		|	<jd>/** Parent Resource */</jd>
		|	<ja>@Rest</ja>(
		|		path=<js>"/parent"</js>,
		|		children={MyChildResource.<jk>class</jk>}
		|	)
		|	<jk>public</jk> MyRootResources <jk>extends</jk> BasicRestServletGroup {...}
	</p>
	<p class='bjava'>
		|	<jd>/** Child Resource */</jd>
 		|	<ja>@Rest</ja>(
		|		path=<js>"/child"</js>  <jc>// Path relative to parent resource.</jc>
		|	)
		|	<jc>// Note that we don't need to extend from RestServlet.</jc>
		|	<jk>public</jk> MyChildResource <jk>extends</jk> BasicRestObject {...} 
	</p>
	<p>
		The path of the child resource gets appended to the path of the parent resource. 
		So in the example above, the child resource is accessed through the URL <l>/parent/child</l>.
	</p>
	<p>
		One advantage of using child resources is that they do not need to be declared in the JEE <l>web.xml</l> 
		file.
		Initialization of and access to the child resources occurs through the parent resource.
		Children can be nested arbitrary deep to create complex REST interfaces with a single top-level REST servlet.
	</p>
	<p>
		As explained earlier, child REST objects typically extend from {@link oajr.servlet.BasicRestObject} or {@link oajr.servlet.BasicRestObjectGroup}
		and not from one of the servlet classes.  They also technically don't even need to extend from those classes
		and can instead just be a normal class annotated with the bare-minimum {@link oajr.annotation.Rest @Rest} and {@link oajr.annotation.RestOp @RestOp}
		annotations.
	</p>
