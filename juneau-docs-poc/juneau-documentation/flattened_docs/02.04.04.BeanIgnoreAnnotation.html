{title:'@BeanIgnore Annotation'}

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		The {@link oaj.annotation.BeanIgnore @BeanIgnore} annotation is used to
		ignore classes, fields, and methods from being interpreted as beans or bean components.
	</p> 
	<p>
		When applied to classes, objects will be converted to strings even though they look like beans.
	</p>
	<p class='bjava'>
		|	<jc>// Not really a bean!  Use toString() instead!</jc>
		|	<ja>@BeanIgnore</ja>
		|	<jk>public class</jk> MyBean {...}
	</p>
	<p>
		When applied to fields and getters/setters, they will be ignored as bean properties.
	</p>
	<p class='bjava'>
		|	<jk>public class</jk> MyBean {
		|		
		|		<jc>// Not a bean property!</jc>
		|		<ja>@BeanIgnore</ja>
		|		<jk>public</jk> String <jf>foo</jf>;
		|		
		|		<jc>// Not a bean property!</jc>
