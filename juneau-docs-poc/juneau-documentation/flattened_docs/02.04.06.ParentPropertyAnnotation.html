{title:'@ParentProperty Annotation'}

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		The {@link oaj.annotation.ParentProperty @ParentProperty} annotation is used to
		identify a setter as a method for adding a parent reference to a child object.
	</p>
	<p>
		A commonly-used case is when you're parsing beans and a child bean has a reference to a parent bean.
	</p>
	<p class='bjava'>
		|	<jk>public class</jk> AddressBook {
		|		<jk>public</jk> List&lt;Person&gt; <jf>people</jf>;
		|	}
		|
		|	<jk>public class</jk> Person {
		|	
		|		<ja>@ParentProperty</ja> 
		|		<jk>public</jk> AddressBook <jf>addressBook</jf>;  <jc>// A reference to the containing address book.</jc>
		|		
		|		<jk>public</jk> String <jf>name</jf>;
		|		
		|		<jk>public char</jk> <jf>sex</jf>;
		|	}
	</p>
	<p>
		Parsers will automatically set this field for you in the child beans.
	</p>
