		<li>
			The escape character <js>'\'</js> can be used when necessary to escape the following characters: 
			<c>$ , { }</c>
		<li>
			<b>WARNING:</b>  It is possible to cause {@link java.lang.StackOverflowError StackOverflowErrors} if 
			your nested variables result in a recursive loop (e.g. the environment variable 
			<c>'MYPROPERTY'</c> has the value <c>'$E{MYPROPERTY}'</c>).
			So don't do that!
		<li>
			As a general rule, this class tries to be as efficient as possible by not creating new strings when not 
			needed.
			<br>For example, calling the resolve method on a string that doesn't contain variables (e.g. 
			<c>resolver.resolve(<js>"foobar"</js>)</c>) will simply be a no-op and return the same string.
