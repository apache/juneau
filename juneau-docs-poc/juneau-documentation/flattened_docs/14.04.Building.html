{title:'Building and Running from Command-Line', created:'8.0.0'}

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		The <l>pom.xml</l> file is a basic Maven build script for creating your microservice
		as an executable uber-jar.
	</p>
	<p>
		The easiest way to build your microservice is to run the following from the project root.
	</p>
	<p class='bconsole'>
		|	mvn clean install
	</p>
	<p>
		Your <c>target</c> directory should now contain the following files:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><c>my-jetty-microservice-1.0.jar</c>
		<li><c>mjm.cfg</c>
	</ul>
	<p>
		To start from a command line, run the following command from inside your <c>target</c> directory:
	</p>
	<p class='bconsole'>
		|	java -jar my-jetty-microservice-1.0.jar
	</p>
	<p>
		You should see the following console output:
	</p>
	<p class='bconsole'>
		|	Running class 'JettyMicroservice' using config file 'mjm.cfg'.
		|	Server started on port 10000
		|	
		|	List of available commands:
		|		exit -- Shut down service
		|		restart -- Restarts service
		|		help -- Commands help
		|	
		|	&gt; 			
	</p>
	<p>
		If you get this error message: <code class='snippet'>java.net.BindException: Address already in use</code>, 
		then this microservice is already running elsewhere and so it cannot bind to port 10000.
	</p>
