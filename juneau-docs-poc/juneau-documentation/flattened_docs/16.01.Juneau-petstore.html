{title:'juneau-petstore', created:'8.2.0', updated:'9.0.0'}

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		The <c>PetStore</c> application is an functional application meant to demonstrate using Juneau with Spring Boot
		to create an end-to-end client/server REST API. 
	</p>
	<p>
		What makes Juneau unique is the ability to create Java interfaces that behave just like RPC but using REST
		as the underlying protocol.  And the technology it not tied to any platform so it can be used in any environment
		by simply pulling in Maven dependencies.  The server-side need only provide the ability to host a servlet.
	</p>
	<p>
		Visit the <a class='doclink' href='https://github.com/apache/juneau-petstore'>GitHub project</a> hosting the application.
	</p>
	<p>
		The project is broken down into the following subprojects:
	</p>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li><c>juneau-petstore-api</c> - Contains the Java interface and DTOs for the petstore application.
		<li><c>juneau-petstore-server</c> - Contains the server-side Java implementation of the petstore Java interface as a REST resource.
		<li><c>juneau-petstore-client</c> - Contains the client-side Java proxy of the petstore Java interface.
	</ul>
