{title:'Extending RestClient', created:'8.2.0'}

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		The <c>RestClient</c> API has been designed to allow for the ability to be easily extended.
		The following example that overrides the primary run method shows how this can be done.
	</p>
	
	<h5 class='figure'>Example:</h5>
	<p class='bjava'>
		|	<jk>public class</jk> MyRestClient <jk>extends</jk> RestClient {
		|
		|		<jc>// Must provide this constructor!</jc>
		|		<jk>public</jk> MyRestClient(ContextProperties <jv>ps</jv>) {
		|			<jk>super</jk>(<jv>ps</jv>);
		|		}
		|
		|		<ja>@Override</ja>
		|		<jk>public</jk> HttpResponse run(HttpHost <jv>target</jv>, HttpRequest <jv>request</jv>, HttpContext <jv>context</jv>) <jk>throws</jk> IOException {
		|			<jc>// Perform special handling of requests.</jc>
		|		}
		|	}
		|
		|	<jc>// Instantiate your client.</jc>
		|	MyRestClient <jv>client</jv> = RestClient.<jsm>create</jsm>().json().build(MyRestClient.<jk>class</jk>);
	</p>
	
	<p>
		The {@link oajrc.RestRequest} and {@link oajrc.RestResponse} objects can also be extended and integrated by overriding the
		{@link oajrc.RestClient#createRequest(URI, String, boolean)} and {@link oajrc.RestClient#createResponse(RestRequest, HttpResponse, Parser)} methods.
	</p>
