		The <l>pom.xml</l> file is a basic Maven build script for creating your microservice
		as an executable uber-jar.
	</p>
	<p>
		The easiest way to build your microservice is to run the following from the project root.
	</p>
	<p class='bconsole'>
		|	mvn clean install
	</p>
	<p>
		Your <c>target</c> directory should now contain the following files:
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li><c>my-springboot-microservice-1.0.jar</c>
	</ul>
	<p>
		To start from a command line, run the following command from inside your <c>target</c> directory:
	</p>
	<p class='bconsole'>
		|	java -jar my-springboot-microservice-1.0.jar
	</p>
	<p>
		You should see the following console output:
