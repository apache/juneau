		<li>
			Reuse instances of serializers and parsers whenever possible.
			<br>They are designed to be thread safe and maintain internal caches of bean metadata to increase performance.
		<li>
			The {@link oaj.BeanTraverseContext.Builder#detectRecursions()} 
			option can cause a performance penalty of 
			around 20%.  
			<br>Therefore, it's recommended that this option be used only when necessary. 
		<li>
			In general, JSON serialization and parsing is about 20% faster than XML.  
			JSON is also more compact than XML.
			<br>MessagePack is fastest and most compact of all.
		<li>
			The RDF parsers are SLOW.
			<br>RDF simply isn't efficient with node traversal, so creating tree structures out of RDF models
			is highly inefficient.  	
		<li>
			The {@link oaj.parser.Parser} methods that take in {@link oaj.ClassMeta} 
			parameters are slightly faster than methods that 
			take in {@link java.lang.Class} or {@link java.lang.Object} parameters, since the latter methods involve 
			hash lookups to resolve to {@link oaj.ClassMeta} parameters.</li>
