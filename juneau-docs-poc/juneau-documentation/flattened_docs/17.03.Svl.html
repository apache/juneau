{title:'juneau-svl', created:'8.2.0'} 

<div class='topic'>
	<p>
		Care must be used when defining new {@link oaj.svl.Var Vars} using the SVL API since mistakes 
		could potentially expose system properties, environment variables, or even file system files.
	</p>
	<p>
		For recap, the SVL support allows you to embed variables of the form <js>"$X{key}"</js> inside strings that
		get resolved to other strings.  The resolved strings themselves can also contain variables that also
		get recursively resolved.  
	</p>
	<p>
		An example of a potential security hole is shown below that could potentially expose any file on a file
		system through a REST request:
	</p>
	<p class='bjava'>
		|	<jk>public</jk> String doUnsafeGet(RestRequest <jv>req</jv>) {
		|		<jc>// Security hole!</jc>
		|		<jk>return</jk> <jv>req</jv>.getVarResolver().resolve(<js>"$RQ{foo}"</js>);
		|	}
	</p>
	<p>
		This code is simply echoing the value of the <c>foo</c> query parameter.
		Now say for example that a bad actor passes in the query string <js>"foo=$F{/some/file/on/file/system}"</js>.
		The <c>$F</c> variable allows you to resolve the contents of files using SVL, and is provided
		by default using the built-in variable resolver returned by the <c>RestRequest</c> object.
		You've potentially just exposed the contents of that file through your REST interface.
	</p>
	<p>
		In reality, the above security hole does not exist because of the following restrictions:
	</p>
	<ul class='spaced-list'>
		<li>
			<c>Vars</c> have two methods {@link oaj.svl.Var#allowNested()} and 
			{@link oaj.svl.Var#allowRecurse()} that can be overridden to prevent recursive processing
			of string variables.  These are both <jk>false</jk> for the <c>$R</c> variable, so the <c>$F</c>
			variable in the result will never get processed and instead be treated as plain text. 
		<li>
			The <c>$F</c> variable only allows you to retrieve files within the JVM starting directory. 
	</ul>
	<p>
		Even though the built-in Juneau variables are safe, special care is needed when defining your own custom
		variables.  If your variable resolves user input in any way, it's HIGHLY recommended that you override the
		{@link oaj.svl.Var#allowNested()} and {@link oaj.svl.Var#allowRecurse()} 
		methods to prevent recursive handling of variables.
	</p>
