# Release 5.1.0.6

**Date:** Sept 21, 2014

Juno 5.1.0.6 is a moderate update.
Simplified API for ~~PojoSwap~~.  
Since it's rarely used, the `beanContext` parameter was replaced with a ~~PojoSwap.getBeanContext()~~ method on
the class.
New simplified way of defining POJO filters without needing to extend ~~PojoSwap~~.
See ~~SurrogateSwap~~ for details.
New \{@link oaj.html.annotation.Html @Html\} annotation.
Will allow the definition of standard XHTML DTOs in future releases.  
For now, ~~Img~~is an example of defining an XHTML element using Juno DTOs.
\{@link oaj.json.JsonParser\} now ignores trailing `';'` characters in input so that it can 
parse strings of the form "var x = \{'foo':'bar'\};".
New `TumblrParserResource` in the samples war file showing how to combine the REST client and server APIs into a single
resource in order to download Tumblr blogs and convert the response into any supported response content type.
