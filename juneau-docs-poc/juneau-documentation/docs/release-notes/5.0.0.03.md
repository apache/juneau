# Release 5.0.0.3

**Date:** Oct 3, 2012

Juno 5.0.0.3 is a minor update.
Support for parsing into read-only beans (i.e. beans with only getters, property values set through constructor args).
To support this, the ~~@BeanConstructor~~ annotation has been added.
Merged separate settings classes back into their base classes (simplifies the API).
~~SerializerGroup SerializerGroups~~ and ~~ParserGroup ParserGroups~~ now share \{@link oaj.BeanContext BeanContexts\} to reduce memory consumption of class type metadata.
