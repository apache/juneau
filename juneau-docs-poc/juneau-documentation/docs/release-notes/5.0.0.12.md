# Release 5.0.0.12

**Date:** Mar 10, 2013

Juno 5.0.0.12 is a minor update.
###### Core API changes
Relaxed method naming conventions when using ~~@BeanProperty~~ annotation.
Methods with zero parameters are interpreted as getters, and methods with one parameter are interpreted as setters.
Eliminated the `BeanProperty.method` annotation, since it's now unnecessary.
###### REST server API changes
Significantly improved response error messages.
Older messages were rather cryptic.   Error conditions should be much easier to debug now.
New `PlainTextRestSerializer` class for serializing "plain/text" requests.
Useful for debugging purposes.
`Readers` and `InputStreams` can now be passed in as ~~@Content~~ parameters if you need direct access to the HTTP body content without involving the parsers.
Equivalent to previously calling \{@link oajr.RestRequest#getInputStream()\} and \{@link oajr.RestRequest#getReader()\}.
Improved support for the `?debug` parameter.
Dumps better information to the log file, such as all header parameters.
