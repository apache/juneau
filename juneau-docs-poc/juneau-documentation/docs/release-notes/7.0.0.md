# Release 7.0.0

**Date:** Oct 25, 2017

This release ups the Java prerequisite to Java 7.
###### juneau-marshall
New class ~~HttpMethodName~~ with valid static string HTTP method names.
###### juneau-dto
Class `org.apache.juneau.dto.Link` renamed to \{@link oaj.dto.LinkString\}.
Helps avoid confusion since there are other Link classes in the library.
###### juneau-rest-server
Annotation `@HtmlDoc(links)` renamed to ~~HtmlDoc.navlinks() navlinks~~.
New annotation ~~HtmlDoc.head() @HtmlDoc(head)~~.
Allows you to specify arbitrary HTML content in the  section of the page.
Removed annotation `@HtmlDoc(favIcon)`.
This was a discouraged way of defining fav-icons anyway, and with the addition of 
`@HtmlDoc(head)`, you can define them using:
```text
head={
""
}
```
Removed several of the HTMLDOC-related methods from the `RestResponse/RestConfig/RestContext`
classes and moved it into the new ~~HtmlDocBuilder~~class.
