# Release 5.0.0.31

**Date:** Aug 9, 2013

Juno 5.0.0.31 is a moderate update.
Simplified the \{@link oaj.serializer.Serializer\} and \{@link oaj.parser.Parser\} class hierarchies.
This reverses a previous change that added a bunch of interfaces in these APIs (and subsequently required compiling with Java 7 to get around a compiler bug).
The new class hierarchy is much simpler to understand.
Added ~~XMLGregorianCalendarSwap~~ to convert these to ISO8601 strings during serialization, and vice versa during parsing.
Added a strict mode to \{@link oaj.json.JsonParser\}.
Added default \{@link oaj.json.JsonParser#DEFAULT_STRICT\} parser.
