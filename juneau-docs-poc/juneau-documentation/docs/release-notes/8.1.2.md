# Release 8.1.2

**Date:** Dec 01, 2019

Juneau 8.1.2 is a moderate release.
###### juneau-marshall
Support for read-only and write-only properties.
~~Bean.bpro()~~
~~Bean.bpwo()~~
\{@link oaj.annotation.Beanp#ro()\}
\{@link oaj.annotation.Beanp#wo()\}
~~BEAN_bpro~~
~~BEAN_bpwo~~
~~Builder.bpro(Map)~~
~~Builder.bpwo(Map)~~
New convenience methods:
~~ObjectMap.parse(CharSequence)~~
~~ObjectList.parse(CharSequence)~~
~~CharMarshall~~and ~~StreamMarshall~~ now have public constructors.
\{@link oaj.annotation.Beanp @Beanp\} replaces ~~BeanProperty @BeanProperty~~.
\{@link oaj.annotation.Beanc @Beanc\} replaces ~~BeanConstructor @BeanConstructor~~.
\{@link oaj.http.remote.Remote @Remote\} replaces ~~RemoteResource @RemoteResource~~.
Shortened names for \{@link oaj.annotation.Bean#dictionary @Bean(dictionary)\} and \{@link oaj.BeanContext.Builder#beanDictionary(Class...)\}.
###### juneau-rest-server
\{@link oajr.annotation.Rest @Rest\} replaces ~~RestResource @RestResource~~ with shorter syntax.
New method ~~RestResponse.setHeaderSafe(String,String)~~to strip invalid characters from header values.
Fixed issues related to invalid characters being set on HTTP header values.
###### juneau-rest-client
\{@link oajrc.RestClient\} is now extendible.  The constructor has been made public and simplified to:
~~ oajrc.RestClient.RestClient(RestClient.Builder)~~.
Duplicate methods between \{@link oajrc.RestClient.Builder\} and \{@link org.apache.http.impl.client.HttpClientBuilder\}
have been made deprecated on the former.  This eliminates the need to try to keep the two builder classes in
sync.
