Custom page templates can be created by implementing the [HtmlDocTemplate](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/HtmlDocTemplate.html)
interface and associating it with your [HtmlDocSerializer](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/HtmlDocSerializer.html) using the [Builder#template(Class)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/HtmlDocSerializer/Builder.html#template(Class))
setting.
- [HtmlDocTemplate](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/HtmlDocTemplate.html)
- \{@link oaj.html.HtmlDocTemplate#writeTo(HtmlDocSerializerSession,HtmlWriter,Object) writeTo(HtmlDocSerializerSession,HtmlWriter,Object)\}
The interface implementation is open-ended allowing you to define the contents of the page any way you wish.
