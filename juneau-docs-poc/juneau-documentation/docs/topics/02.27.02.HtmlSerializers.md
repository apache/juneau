The [HtmlSerializer](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/HtmlSerializer.html) class is used to serialize POJOs into HTML.
The [HtmlDocSerializer](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/html/HtmlDocSerializer.html) class is the same but wraps the serialized POJO
inside a document template consisting of header, nav, aside, and footer sections.
The class hierarchy for the builder of this serializer is:
- [Builder](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/Context/Builder.html)
- [Builder](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/BeanContextable/Builder.html)
