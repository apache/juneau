[Rest](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html)-annotated classes get automated timing and error statistic information for all @RestOp
and lifecycle-event annotated methods on the class.
If you extend from [BasicRestServlet](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestServlet.html) or [BasicRestObject](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestObject.html), then
the statics are made available through the REST interface via the following method:
```java

```

The default REST configuration provides a link to the stats in the navlinks section of the page:
The exception hash shown is the same hash that is shown in the log file and provides a quick way of locating
the exception in the logs.
Programmatic access to the statistics are provided via the following methods:
- [RestContext](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/RestContext.html)
- [getStats()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/RestContext.html#getStats())
