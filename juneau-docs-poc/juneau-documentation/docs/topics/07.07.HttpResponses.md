These are built upon existing HttpComponents APIs:
- \{@code org.apache.http.HttpMessage\}
- \{@code org.apache.http.HttpResponse\}
- [BasicHttpResponse](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/response/BasicHttpResponse.html) - 100-399 response codes
- [BasicHttpException](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/response/BasicHttpException.html) - 400+ response codes
The most common location where these responses are used are in REST operation methods described later.
##### Example:
```java
@RestDelete(path="/{id}")
public Ok doDelete(@Path int id) throws NotFound, Unauthorized {
    pojoService.delete(pojoService.find(id).orElseThrow(NotFound::new));
    return Ok.OK;
}
```
The following classes are also provided for constructing your own custom responses:
- [BasicHttpException](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/response/BasicHttpException.html)
- [BasicHttpResponse](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/response/BasicHttpResponse.html)
