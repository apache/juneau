title: "Java Method Return Types"
---

The return type of the Java method can be any serializable POJO as defined in [TODO: POJO Categories](TODO.md).
It can also be void if the method is not sending any output (e.g. a request redirect) or is
setting the output using the [RestResponse#setContent(Object)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/RestResponse.html#setContent(Object)) method.
##### Example:
```java
@RestGet
public String doGet() {
    return "Hello World!";
}
```

- **Annotated parameters (either on the parameter or parameter type):**
- [Response](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Response.html)
REST Java methods can also generate a response via the following:
-
By calling [RestResponse#setContent(Object)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/RestResponse.html#setContent(Object)) with any of the types above.
-
By accessing the [Writer](../apidocs/java/io/Writer.html) directly by calling
[RestResponse#getNegotiatedWriter()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/RestResponse.html#getNegotiatedWriter()) and writing the output yourself.
##### Example:
```java
// Equivalent method 1
@RestGet("/example1/{personId}")
public Person doGet1(@Path("personId") UUID personId) {
    Person person = getPersonById(personId);
    return person;
}

// Equivalent method 2
@RestGet("/example2/{personId}")
public void doGet2(RestResponse res, @Path("personId") UUID personId) {
    Person person = getPersonById(personId);
    res.setContent(person);
}
```
Additional parameter types can be defined via the annotation [Rest#responseProcessors()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html#responseProcessors()) or by calling \{@link oajr.RestContext.Builder#responseProcessors(Class...)\}.
##### Example:
```java
@Rest(
    responseProcessors={ MyResponseProcessor.class }  // Option #1 - Via annotation
)
public class MyResource extends BasicRestObject {

    // Option #2 - Programmatically
    @RestInit
    public void init(RestContext.Builder builder) {
        builder.responseProcessors(MyResponseProcessor.class);
    }
}
```
