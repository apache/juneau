title: "Deployment"

REST resources are deployed in the following ways:
- Deployed in a J2EE container as a servlet.
- Deployed in a Spring Boot environment as a servlet.
- Deployed as a child of another REST resource.
When deployed in a J2EE container, you MUST extend from one of the servlet classes.
:::note
When deployed as a child of another resource, you MAY extend from one of the servlet classes but it's
not necessary.
The only requirement is that the class be annotated with @Rest and have one of the following constructors
if they aren't already Spring Beans:
- `public T()`
- `public T(RestContext.Builder)`
:::
Deployment in a servlet container is typically done by adding a servlet entry for the top-level resources to the JEE web.xml.
Deployment in a Spring Boot environment involves defining your top-level resources as Spring Beans.
Top-level resources must extend from [BasicSpringRestServlet](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/springboot/BasicSpringRestServlet.html) or [BasicSpringRestServletGroup](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/springboot/BasicSpringRestServletGroup.html)
so that Juneau can hook into the injection framework provided by Spring.  Child resource CAN be defined as injected Spring Beans
as well but it is not a requirement.
##### Example Spring Boot Configuration
```java
@SpringBootApplication
@Controller
public class SpringBootAppConfig {

    @Bean
    public MyRootResources getRootResources() {
        ...
    }

    @Bean
    public MyChildResource getMyChildResource() {
        ...
    }

    @Bean
    public ServletRegistrationBean getRootServlet(RootResources rootResources) {
        return new ServletRegistrationBean(rootResources, "/*");
    }
}
```
