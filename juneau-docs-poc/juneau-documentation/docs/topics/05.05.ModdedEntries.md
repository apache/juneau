title: "Modded/Encoded Entries"
---

The following method can be used to associates entry modifiers to a config:
- [Builder](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/config/Config/Builder.html)
- \{@link oaj.config.Config.Builder#mods(Mod...) mods(Mod...)\}
Mods are used to modify values before being persisted.  This can be used to
replace or encode sensitive information.  They are denoted by a single
character that gets appended between angle brackets on the property name (e.g. key).
Multiple modifiers can be denoted by multiple characters (e.g. key) and
are applied/removed in the order denoted.
The framework comes built-in with a simple [xor-encode](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/config/mod/XorEncodeMod.html) mod tied
to the '*' character.  The following shows how it is used:
```ini
[MyHost]
url = http://localhost:9080/foo
user = me
password = {AwwJVhwUQFZEMg==}
```
Custom encoders can be used to provide your own encoding support by implementing the [Mod](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/config/mod/Mod.html) class.
- [Mod](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/config/mod/Mod.html)
- [apply(String)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/config/mod/Mod.html#apply(String))
- [remove(String)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/config/mod/Mod.html#remove(String))
- [isApplied(String)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/config/mod/Mod.html#isApplied(String))
Unmodified values are encoded when the file is saved using the [Config#commit()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/config/Config.html#commit()) method.
They can also be encoded immediately by calling [Config#applyMods()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/config/Config.html#applyMods()) which can typically
be done during JVM startup to immediately encode any unencoded passwords in the file.
