title: "Lifecycle Hooks"
---

Lifecycle hooks allow you to hook into lifecycle events of the servlet/resource creation and REST calls.
For example, if you want to add an initialization method to your resource:
```java
@Rest(...)
public class MyResource extends BasicRestObject {

    // Our database.
    private Map myDatabase;

    @RestInit
    public void initMyDatabase(RestContext.Builder builder) throws Exception {
        myDatabase = new LinkedHashMap();
    }
}
```
Or if you want to intercept REST calls:
```java
@Rest(...)
public class MyResource extends BasicRestObject {

    // Add a request attribute to all incoming requests.
    @RestPreCall
    public void onPreCall(RestRequest req) {
        req.setAttribute("foo", "bar");
    }
}
```
The following lifecycle annotations are provided.
- Resource lifecycle events:
- [RestInit](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestInit.html) - Right before initialization.
- [RestPostInit](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestPostInit.html) - Right after initialization.
- [RestDestroy](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestDestroy.html) - Right before servlet destroy.
- REST call lifecycle events:
- [RestStartCall](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestStartCall.html) - At the beginning of a REST call.
[RestPreCall](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestPreCall.html) - Right before the @RestOp method is invoked.
[RestPostCall](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestPostCall.html) - Right after the @RestOp method is invoked.
- [RestEndCall](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestEndCall.html) - At the end of the REST call after the response has been flushed.
