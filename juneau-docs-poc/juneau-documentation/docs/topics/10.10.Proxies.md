title: "REST Proxies"
---

One of the more powerful features of the REST client class is the ability to produce Java interface proxies against
arbitrary 3rd party REST resources.
The methods to retrieve remote interfaces are:
- [RestClient](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient.html)
`[getRemote(Class)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient.html#getRemote(Class)) returns T`
`\{@link oajrc.RestClient#getRemote(Class,Object) getRemote(Class,Object)\} returns T`
`\{@link oajrc.RestClient#getRemote(Class,Object,Serializer,Parser) getRemote(Class,Object,Serializer,Parser)\} returns T`
Annotations are used on the interface and interface methods to specify how to convert input and output to HTTP headers, query parameters, form
post parameters, or request/response bodies.
- [remote](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote.html)
- [Remote](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/Remote.html) - Applied to interface class.
- [RemoteOp](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteOp.html) - Applied to interface methods.
- [annotation](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation.html)
- [Content](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Content.html)
- [Header](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Header.html)
- [FormData](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/FormData.html)
- [Query](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Query.html)
- [Path](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Path.html)
- [Request](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Request.html)
- [Response](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Response.html)
##### Example:
```java
@Remote(path="/petstore")
public interface PetStore {

    @RemotePost("/pets")
    Pet addPet(
        @Content CreatePet createPet,
        @Header("E-Tag") UUID etag,
        @Query("debug") boolean debug
    );
}
```
```java
// Use a RestClient with default JSON 5 support.
RestClient client = RestClient.create().json5().build();

// Instantiate our proxy interface.
PetStore store = client.getRemote(PetStore.class, "http://localhost:10000");

// Use it to create a pet.
CreatePet createPet = new CreatePet("Fluffy", 9.99);
Pet pet = store.addPet(createPet, UUID.randomUUID(), true);
```
The call above translates to the following REST call:
```text
POST http://localhost:10000/petstore/pets?debug=true HTTP/1.1
Accept: application/json
Content-Type: application/json
E-Tag: 475588d4-0b27-4f56-9296-cc683251d314

{
    name: 'Fluffy',
    price: 9.99
}
```
The @RemoteOp annotations can be eliminated if you use specific naming conventions on your
method names to identify the HTTP method and path.
##### Example:
```java
@Remote(path="/petstore")
public interface PetStore {

    // @RemoteOp optional since method and path is inferred from method name.
    String postPets(@Content CreatePet pet);
}
```
