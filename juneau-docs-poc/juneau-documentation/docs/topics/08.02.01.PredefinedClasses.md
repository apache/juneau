The following example represents the bare-minimum needed
for deploying a top-level REST endpoint with basic JSON marshalling support:
```java
@Rest(
    path="/mypath",
    serializers=JsonSerializer.class,
    parsers=JsonParser.class
)
public class MyResource extends RestServlet {

    @RestGet(path="/")
    public Object getPojo() {
        ...
    }
}
```
The [RestServlet](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/RestServlet.html) class provides all the logic for starting up your REST
application when the servlet container calls [init(ServletConfig)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/RestServlet.html#init(ServletConfig)).
On startup, it scans your class for annotations and sets up
all of your serializers and parsers.  It then does this recursively for all child resources.
Users will typically not extend directly from [RestServlet](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/RestServlet.html).  Instead, several classes are provided by the framework to provide additional
functionality and to handle different use-cases.  Users will typically extend from one of these `Basic*` classes:
- [HttpServlet](../apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html)
- [RestServlet](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/RestServlet.html)
[BasicRestServlet](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestServlet.html) implements [BasicRestOperations](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestOperations.html), [BasicUniversalConfig](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/config/BasicUniversalConfig.html)
[BasicRestServletGroup](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestServletGroup.html) implements [BasicGroupOperations](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicGroupOperations.html)
- [SpringRestServlet](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/springboot/SpringRestServlet.html)
[BasicSpringRestServlet](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/springboot/BasicSpringRestServlet.html) implements [BasicRestOperations](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestOperations.html), [BasicUniversalConfig](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/config/BasicUniversalConfig.html)
[BasicSpringRestServletGroup](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/springboot/BasicSpringRestServletGroup.html) implements [BasicGroupOperations](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicGroupOperations.html)
- [RestObject](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/RestObject.html)
[BasicRestObject](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestObject.html) implements [BasicRestOperations](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestOperations.html), [BasicJsonConfig](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/config/BasicJsonConfig.html)
[BasicRestObjectGroup](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestObjectGroup.html) implements [BasicGroupOperations](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicGroupOperations.html)
The [RestServlet](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/RestServlet.html)
class itself is not configured with any serializers or parsers.  However, it does
provide several convenience methods to be aware of:
- [RestServlet](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/RestServlet.html)
- Logging methods:
- \{@link oajr.servlet.RestServlet#log(Level,String,Object...) log(Level,String,Object...)\}
- \{@link oajr.servlet.RestServlet#log(Level,Throwable,String,Object...) log(Level,Throwable,String,Object...)\}
- [log(String)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/RestServlet.html#log(String))
- \{@link oajr.servlet.RestServlet#log(String,Throwable) log(String,Throwable)\}
- Other methods:
- [getContext()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/RestServlet.html#getContext())
- [getPath()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/RestServlet.html#getPath())
- [getRequest()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/RestServlet.html#getRequest())
- [getResponse()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/RestServlet.html#getResponse())
The `Basic*` classes implement the [BasicRestOperations](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestOperations.html) interface
which defines common endpoints for swagger documentation, statistics, and serving static files:
```java
public interface BasicRestOperations {

    @RestGet(path="/api/*")
    public [Swagger](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/dto/swagger/Swagger.html) [getSwagger](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestOperations.html#getSwagger(RestRequest))([RestRequest](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/RestRequest.html) req);

    @RestGet(path="/htdocs/*")
    public [HttpResource](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/resource/HttpResource.html) {@link oajr.servlet.BasicRestOperations#getHtdoc(String,Locale) getHtdoc}(@Path String path, Locale locale);

    @RestGet(path="favicon.ico")
    public [HttpResource](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/resource/HttpResource.html) [getFavIcon](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestOperations.html#getFavIcon())();

    @RestGet(path="/stats")
    public [RestContextStats](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/stats/RestContextStats.html) [getStats](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestOperations.html#getStats(RestRequest))([RestRequest](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/RestRequest.html) req);

    @RestOp(method=ANY, path="/error")
    public void [error](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestOperations.html#error())();
}
```
The `Basic*` classes also implement [BasicJsonConfig](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/config/BasicJsonConfig.html) interface which
provides basic JSON marshalling support.  Other config interfaces are available as
well to quickly provide different types of marshalling support.  Note that these interfaces
do not define any methods but rather simply provide a set of commonly-used annotations so that
you don't need to define them on all your classes.
- [BasicJsonConfig](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/config/BasicJsonConfig.html)
- [BasicJsonHtmlConfig](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/config/BasicJsonHtmlConfig.html)
- [BasicJson5Config](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/config/BasicJson5Config.html)
- [BasicOpenApiConfig](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/config/BasicOpenApiConfig.html)
- [BasicUniversalConfig](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/config/BasicUniversalConfig.html)
For example, if you want to provide a resource that supports all languages in Juneau,
simply add the [BasicUniversalConfig](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/config/BasicUniversalConfig.html) interface like so:
```java
@Rest(...)
public class MyResource extends RestServlet implements BasicUniversalConfig {
    ...
}
```
The `*Group` classes implement the [BasicGroupOperations](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicGroupOperations.html) interface which provides an additional REST endpoint for listing and navigating child resources:
```java
public interface BasicGroupOperations {

    @RestGet(path="/")
    public [ChildResourceDescriptions](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/beans/ChildResourceDescriptions.html) [getChildren](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicGroupOperations.html#getChildren(RestRequest))([RestRequest](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/RestRequest.html) req);
}
```
The `*Spring*` classes are meant to be used in Spring Boot environments so that you can
take full advantage of the Spring Framework for injecting dependencies on child resources
and helper classes.
The `*Object*` classes provide the same functionality as the servlet
classes but do not extend from [HttpServlet](../apidocs/jakarta/servlet/http/HttpServlet.html).
This becomes important in Spring Boot environments where you may want to
define child resources as Spring Beans but don't want Spring Boot to auto-detect
them as servlets to be deployed as top-level resources.  This is less important
in standard servlet containers that don't auto-deploy servlets.  In those
environments, you can also use servlet classes for child resources.
The following is a breakdown of which classes you will use in different cases:
- Top level resources in a servlet container:
- [BasicRestServlet](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestServlet.html)
- [BasicRestServletGroup](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestServletGroup.html)
- Top level resources in a Spring Boot environment:
- [BasicSpringRestServlet](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/springboot/BasicSpringRestServlet.html)
- [BasicSpringRestServletGroup](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/springboot/BasicSpringRestServletGroup.html)
- Child resources:
- [BasicRestObject](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestObject.html)
- [BasicRestObjectGroup](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestObjectGroup.html)
