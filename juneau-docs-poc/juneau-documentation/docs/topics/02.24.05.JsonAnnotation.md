title: "@Json Annotation"
---

The [@Json](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/json/annotation/Json.html) annotation
is used to override the behavior of [JsonSerializer](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/json/JsonSerializer.html) on individual bean classes or properties.
The annotation can be applied to beans as well as other objects serialized to other types (e.g. strings).
- [Json](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/json/annotation/Json.html)
- [wrapperAttr](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/json/annotation/Json.html#wrapperAttr())
The [@Json(wrapperAttr)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/json/annotation/Json.html#wrapperAttr()) annotation
can be used to wrap beans inside a JSON object with a specified attribute name.
##### Example:
@Json(wrapperAttr="personBean")
public class Person \{
public String name = "John Smith";
\}
The following shows the JSON representation with and without the annotation present:
Without annotation
With annotation
\{
name: 'John Smith'
\}
\{
personBean: \{
name: 'John Smith'
\}
\}
