title: "Serializing"
---

The following methods are used for serializing `Config` objects back into INI files:
- [Config](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/config/Config.html)
- [writeTo(Writer)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/config/Config.html#writeTo(Writer))
- [toString()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/config/Config.html#toString())
Both methods are thread safe.
