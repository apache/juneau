title: "Building and Running from Command-Line"
---

The pom.xml file is a basic Maven build script for creating your microservice
as an executable uber-jar.
The easiest way to build your microservice is to run the following from the project root.
```bash
mvn clean install
```
Your `target` directory should now contain the following files:
- `my-springboot-microservice-1.0.jar`
To start from a command line, run the following command from inside your `target` directory:
```bash
java -jar my-springboot-microservice-1.0.jar
```
You should see the following console output:
```bash
