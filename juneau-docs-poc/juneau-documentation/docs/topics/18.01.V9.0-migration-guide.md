title: "v9.0 Migration Guide"
---

The following guide can be used to help migrate your code to v9.0.  Note that you can also refer to the Release Notes for
changes as well.
Old
New
@RestMethod annotation.
Has been replaced with [RestOp](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestOp.html), [RestGet](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestGet.html), [RestPut](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestPut.html), [RestPost](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestPost.html), [RestDelete](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestDelete.html), [RestOptions](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/RestOptions.html)
@RemoteMethod annotation.
Has been replaced with [RemoteOp](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteOp.html), [RemoteGet](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteGet.html), [RemotePut](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemotePut.html), [RemotePost](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemotePost.html), [RemoteDelete](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteDelete.html).
`BasicRestServletJena`, `BasicRestServletJenaGroup` classes.
These have been removed in 9.0 due to the removal of the Jena packages (due to security issues).  Replace
with [BasicRestServlet](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestServlet.html) and [BasicRestServletGroup](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestServletGroup.html).
@Body annotation.
Has been renamed to @Content (to better match HTTP naming conventions such as Content-Type/Content-Encoding headers).
`@Query(_default)`, `@FormData(_default)`.
Has been renamed to [Query#def](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Query.html#def) / [FormData#def](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/FormData.html#def).  Note however that @RestOp-annotated parameters
now also support use of Optional parameters which simplifies the coding of default values.
`@Rest(reqHeaders)`.
Has been renamed to [Rest#defaultRequestHeaders](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html#defaultRequestHeaders) and added [Rest#defaultResponseHeaders](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/annotation/Rest.html#defaultResponseHeaders).
@Rest(staticFiles).
Changed from a string array to a `Class<? extends StaticFiles>`.  If you're extending from
[BasicRestServlet](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestServlet.html)/[BasicRestObject](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/servlet/BasicRestObject.html), the \{@link oajr.servlet.BasicRestOperations#getHtdoc(String,Locale)\}
is already implemented for you to provide static files under the sub-URI /htdocs/*.  The default implementation for finding
static files is [BasicStaticFiles](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/staticfile/BasicStaticFiles.html) which provides basic out-of-the-box functionality, so you can usually
just remove the previous `@Rest(staticFiles)` value.
