title: "@RemoteOp"
---

The [@RemoteOp](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteOp.html) annotation is applied to methods
of @Remote-annotated interfaces to identify REST endpoints.
- [RemoteOp](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteOp.html)
- [method](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteOp.html#method)
- [path](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteOp.html#path)
- [returns](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteOp.html#returns)
Specialized sub-annotations are provided for common HTTP methods:
- [RemoteGet](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteGet.html)
- [RemotePost](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemotePost.html)
- [RemotePut](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemotePut.html)
- [RemotePatch](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemotePatch.html)
- [RemoteDelete](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteDelete.html)
##### @RemoteOp(method/path)
The HTTP method and path are mapped to a Java method using the `method` and `path` annotations.
##### Example:
```java
@Remote
public interface PetStore {

    // GET /pets/{petId}
    @RemoteGet("/pets/{petId}")
    Pet getPet(@Path("petId") int id);
}
```
The Java method name can be anything.
##### Inferred method/path
In such cases, `method` and `path` annotations are optional if you follow certain naming
conventions on your method that identify the method and path.
For example, the `getPet` method below defaults to `GET /pet`:
```java
@Remote
public interface PetStore {

    // GET /pet
    @RemoteOp
    Pet getPet(...);
}
```
In such cases, the @RemoteOp annotation is optional.
Method names matching the following pattern are assumed to be implying the HTTP method name:
```text
(get|put|post|delete|options|head|connect|trace|patch).*
```
```text
do(?i)(get|put|post|delete|options|head|connect|trace|patch)
```
##### Examples:
Java method name
Inferred HTTP method
Inferred HTTP path
getPet()
GET
/pet
get()
GET
/
postPet()
POST
/pet
fooPet()
[default]
/fooPet
doGet()
GET
/
doGET()
GET
/
doFoo()
[default]
/doFoo
##### @RemoteOp(returns)
The return type of the Java methods of can be any of the following:
-
void/[Void](../apidocs/java/lang/Void.html)
- Don't parse any response.
Note that the method will still throw a runtime exception if an error HTTP status is returned.
-
Any [TODO: parseable](TODO.md) POJO
- The body of the response will be converted to the POJO using the parser defined on the
`RestClient` based on the `Content-Type` of the response.
-
Any [@Response](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation/Response.html)-annotated type. (described later)
-
`HttpResponse`
- Returns the raw `HttpResponse` returned by the inner `HttpClient`.
-
[Reader](../apidocs/java/io/Reader.html)
- Returns access to the raw reader of the response.
-
[InputStream](../apidocs/java/io/InputStream.html)
- Returns access to the raw input stream of the response.
-
A [Future](../apidocs/java/util/concurrent/Future.html) or [CompletableFuture](../apidocs/java/util/concurrent/CompletableFuture.html) of anything on this list.
If you're only interested in the HTTP status code of the response, you can use the [returns](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteOp.html#returns())
annotation with a value of [STATUS](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/remote/RemoteReturn.html#STATUS):
##### Example:
```java
@Remote
public interface PetStore {

    // POST /pets
    // Returns HTTP status code.
    @RemotePost(returns=STATUS)
    int pets(...);
}
```
If your `RestClient` does not have a parser associated with it, then the value is converted directly from a String using
the rules defined in [TODO: POJO Categories](TODO.md).
