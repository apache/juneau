title: "Annotations"
---

The [annotation](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/http/annotation.html) package contains annotations for defining both server and client side
APIs.  The server-side APIs also use it for producing auto-generated Swagger documentation through
the REST API itself.

remote proxies.  These will be described later in those sections.
