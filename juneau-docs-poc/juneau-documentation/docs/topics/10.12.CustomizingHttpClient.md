title: "Customizing HttpClient"
---

Several methods are provided for customizing the underlying HTTP client and client builder classes:
- [Builder](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html)
- [httpClientBuilder(HttpClientBuilder)](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#httpClientBuilder(HttpClientBuilder)) - Set the client builder yourself.
- [createHttpClientBuilder()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#createHttpClientBuilder()) - Override to create the client builder.
- [createHttpClient()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#createHttpClient()) - Override to create the client.
- [createConnectionManager()](../apidocs/org/apache/juneau/rest/client/RestClient/Builder.html#createConnectionManager()) - Override to create the connection management.
Additionally, all methods on the `HttpClientBuilder` class have been extended with fluent setters.
##### Example:
```java
// Create a client with customized HttpClient settings.
MyBean bean = RestClient
    .create()
    .disableRedirectHandling()
    .connectionManager(myConnectionManager)
    .addInterceptorFirst(myHttpRequestInterceptor)
    .build();
```
Refer to the \{@code org.apache.http.client.impl.HttpClientBuilder\} docs for more information.
